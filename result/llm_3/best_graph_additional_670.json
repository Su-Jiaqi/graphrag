A leakage test would be necessary to verify the water resistance of the watch.\n\n2.

Backlight: As G-Shock watches often feature a backlight for visibility in low-light conditions, it would be important to test for leakage to ensure that the backlight does not compromise the water resistance of the watch.\n\nOverall, features such as water resistance, specialized diving capabilities, and any components that may compromise the integrity of the watch's seal would require thorough leakage testing to ensure the watch's durability and performance in challenging environments.",
