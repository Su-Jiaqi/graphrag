NaGISA is the first project of the larger CoML effort (Census of Marine Life) to have global participation in actual field work. The actual procedures of this project involve inexpensive collection equipment (for easy universal participation). This equipment is used to photograph sampling sites, to actually take samples from the sites, and to process these samples. At each site throughout the world, samples are taken from the intertidal zone out to a depth of 10 meters (and optionally out to 20 meters depth). These samples are then processed (the organisms are isolated) and then analyzed and catalogued. The information (regarding the kind and number of organisms analyzed) is sent to the global headquarters of NaGISA- the University of Kyoto in Japan. All of this information is then collated on the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS website). The end goal of the larger CoML effort is to find what \"was\", what \"is\", and what \"will be\" in the world's oceans. For NaGISA the goal is to find this in the world's in-shore areas.",

            "Postpipe\nIn archaeology, a postpipe (or post pipe) is the remains of an upright timber placed in a posthole. Given the right conditions, timbers may survive over long periods of time and a recovered postpipe can simply be of solid wood. Under less preservative conditions however, only a dark circular stain of organic material may be left in the fill of the posthole observable in plan and section. This differs in consistency from the less organic backfill of the posthole and can be identified simply through this change in make-up. The size and depth and of the postpipe can provide information as to any reuse of the posthole especially if several different postpipes can be identified. They can also indicate the species of wood used and help suggest the nature of the structure that the timber once supported. The term was first used by Maud Cunnington when she excavated the site of Woodhenge in the English county of Wiltshire during the 1920s and found numerous examples of decomposed timber posts.",
            "Sharon Gannon\nSharon Gannon (born July 4, 1951 in Washington, D.C.) is a yoga teacher, animal rights advocate, musician, author, dancer/choreographer and painter. Along with David Life, she is the co-founder of the Jivamukti Yoga Method which contributed to the exponential rise in popularity of yoga in the west during the late 20th century. The Jivamukti Yoga Method distinguishes itself as a path to enlightenment by promoting compassion for all beings, challenging the modern belief that enslaving and exploiting animals and the natural world is our right as the dominant species. The Jivamukti Yoga Method teaches its students that they must be willing to promote the happiness of all beings without exception if they wish to realize their fullest capacity for joy. Jivamukti students are encouraged to adopt a diet that eliminates all animal products (vegan) as this is the diet that causes the least amount of harm to the earth and other beings, humans included. Core to the teachings of Jivamukti Yoga is the concept of shunyata or (emptiness) which is found in the ancient yogic scriptures. This idea can be simply stated as: everything you see and experience in the world comes from your perception of it. If you want to change someone or to change the world, you start by changing yourself by changing your views. When you begin to embrace this concept and put it into practice then you cannot find solace in complaining or blaming others. You are freed from seeing yourself as a victim of others or of circumstances. According to Gannon: \"How you treat others will determine how others treat you. How others treat you will determine how you see yourself. How you see yourself will determine who you are.\"",

It is concerned with independently supervising and monitoring the quality of asset management accounts with the aim of ensuring performance and quality in order to provide the required benefit for the asset management client. Dependent on setup, investment controlling not only encompasses controlling activities but also can include areas from compliance to performance review. Investment controlling aspects can also be taken into consideration by asset management clients or investment advisers/consultants and consequently it is likely that these stakeholders also run certain investment controlling activities."

First, it identifies the specific award first won by John McCormick, which requires retrieval of historical information related to awards given by Crystal Palace F.C. independently. Secondly, it identifies the award most recently won by Wilfried Zaha, again requiring retrieval and reasoning independently from the first step. Finally, the third node synthesizes these two pieces of information to identify the common award, if any, linking them to answer the original question."

Since the inaugural award was made to John McCormick in 1972, 34 different players have won the award. Nine of these players have won the award for a second time, the most recent being Wilfried Zaha. Two players have received the award on more than two occasions, Jim Cannon won it three times and Juli\u00e1n Speroni won it four times. Paul Hinshelwood was the first to win the trophy in consecutive seasons, a feat since emulated by Andrew Johnson, Juli\u00e1n Speroni and Wilfried Zaha.

Along with Wanderers F.C., Barnes F.C. and the N.N. Club, they were described by Charles W.

The season started well before taking a turn for the worse when the club was placed into administration at the end of January 2010, culminating in manager Neil Warnock leaving his job just over a month later and being replaced by Paul Hart, whose tenure saw the club survive relegation on the final day of the season.",

The previous season had seen Palace finish one place above the relegation zone, having been deducted ten points for going into administration. The CPFC 2010 consortium completed a takeover of the club in the close season and installed former Scotland manager George Burley as the club's new boss, with club legend Dougie Freedman continuing his role as assistant manager. However, after a poor start to the season, Burley was sacked on New Year's Day and Freedman named manager the following week. Under Freedman fortunes improved, and the club secured another season at Championship level shortly before the conclusion of the campaign."
