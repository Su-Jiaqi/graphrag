There is some idea that it descended into Greek from the Proto-Indo-European language. In that regard Robert Graves has proposed the only Greek derivation available. Perseus might be from the Greek verb, \"\u03c0\u03ad\u03c1\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd\" (\"perthein\"), \u201cto waste, ravage, sack, destroy\u201d, some form of which appears in Homeric epithets. According to Carl Darling Buck (\"Comparative Grammar of Greek and Latin\"), the \"\u2013eus\" suffix is typically used to form an agent noun, in this case from the aorist stem, \"pers-\". \"Pers-eus\" therefore is a sacker of cities; that is, a soldier by occupation, a fitting name for the first Mycenaean warrior.",

            "NaGISA\nNaGISA (Natural Geography in Shore Areas or Natural Geography of In-Shore Areas) is an international collaborative effort aimed at inventorying, cataloguing, and monitoring biodiversity of the in-shore area. So named for the Japanese word \"nagisa\" (\"where the land meets the sea\"), it is an Apronym. NaGISA is the first project of the larger CoML effort (Census of Marine Life) to have global participation in actual field work. The actual procedures of this project involve inexpensive collection equipment (for easy universal participation). This equipment is used to photograph sampling sites, to actually take samples from the sites, and to process these samples. At each site throughout the world, samples are taken from the intertidal zone out to a depth of 10 meters (and optionally out to 20 meters depth). These samples are then processed (the organisms are isolated) and then analyzed and catalogued. The information (regarding the kind and number of organisms analyzed) is sent to the global headquarters of NaGISA- the University of Kyoto in Japan. All of this information is then collated on the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS website). The end goal of the larger CoML effort is to find what \"was\", what \"is\", and what \"will be\" in the world's oceans. For NaGISA the goal is to find this in the world's in-shore areas.",

            "Perseus\nBecause of the obscurity of the name Perseus and the legendary character of its bearer, most etymologists presume that it might be pre-Greek; however, the name of Perseus\u2019 native city was Greek and so were the names of his wife and relatives. There is some idea that it descended into Greek from the Proto-Indo-European language. In that regard Robert Graves has proposed the only Greek derivation available. Perseus might be from the Greek verb, \"\u03c0\u03ad\u03c1\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd\" (\"perthein\"), \u201cto waste, ravage, sack, destroy\u201d, some form of which appears in Homeric epithets. According to Carl Darling Buck (\"Comparative Grammar of Greek and Latin\"), the \"\u2013eus\" suffix is typically used to form an agent noun, in this case from the aorist stem, \"pers-\". \"Pers-eus\" therefore is a sacker of cities; that is, a soldier by occupation, a fitting name for the first Mycenaean warrior.",

            "Speedpass\nSpeedpass is a keychain RFID device introduced in 1997 by Mobil Oil Corp. (which merged with Exxon to become ExxonMobil in 1999) for electronic payment. It was originally developed by Verifone. As of 2004, more than seven million people possess Speedpass tags, which can be used at approximately 10,000 Exxon, Mobil and Esso gas stations worldwide. At one point, Speedpass was deployed experimentally in fast-food restaurants and supermarkets in select markets. McDonald's alone deployed Speedpass in over 400 Chicago area restaurants. The test was deemed a failure and McDonald's removed the scanners from all their restaurants in mid-2004. Additionally, the New England grocery chain Stop & Shop tested Speedpass at their Boston area stores; the units were removed in early 2005. Speedpass has also been previously available through a Speedpass Car Tag and a Speedpass-enabled Timex watch."
