This company served as a platform for Balanchine's innovative choreography and later influenced his work at the School of American Ballet and in his later companies.\n\nBalanchine also founded the American Ballet, the first professional ballet company he created in the United States. This company, managed by Alexander Merovitch, provided a platform for Balanchine's choreography and the development of ballet in America. Additionally, he played a role in the careers of prominent ballerinas such as Gelsey Kirkland and Heather Watts, both of whom were principal dancers with the New York City Ballet and had numerous principal roles created for them by Balanchine.\n\nFurthermore, Balanchine's influence extended to other performing arts centers such as the Toronto Centre for the Arts, the Jose Thomas Performing Arts Centre in India, and the North Wall Arts Centre in Oxford. His impact on the performing arts is also evident in the liberal arts education programs offered by various colleges and universities, reflecting his influence on the broader cultural and educational landscape.
