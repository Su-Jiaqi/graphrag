Bento dos Santos, together with other partners such as Eduardo Catroga, founded the metals brokerage and trading company Quimibro. In the late 1980s, Pedro Passos Coelho, future Prime Minister of Portugal, was invited by a cousin to work there as a collaborator. Bento dos Santos studied also economics at the \"Instituto Superior de Economia e Gest\u00e3o\" of the Technical University of Lisbon, but he did not graduate. Beyond Quimibro, Bento dos Santos founded other ventures like Quinta do Monte d'Oiro, a winery. In the 2000s, Bento dos Santos became popular due to his cuisine progames \"O Sentido do Gosto\" (2007) on the Portuguese television RTP and \"Segredos do Vinho\" (SIC, 2004).

In Biblical studies, genres are usually associated with whole books of the Bible, because each of its books comprises a complete textual unit; however, a book may be internally composed of a variety of styles, forms, and so forth, and thus bear the characteristics of more than one genre (for example, chapter 1 of the Book of Revelation is prophetic/visionary; chapters 2 and 3 are similar to the epistle genre; etc.).",

They originated in Mississippi in the early 1960s under the leadership of Samuel Bowers, its first Grand Wizard. The White Knights of Mississippi were formed in 1964, and they included roughly 200 members of the Original Knights of Louisiana. The White Knights were not interested in holding public demonstrations or in letting any information about themselves get out to the masses. Similar to the United Klans of America (UKA), the White Knights of Mississippi were very secretive about their group. Within a year, their membership was up to around six thousand, and they had Klaverns in over half of the counties in Mississippi.

In Biblical studies, genres are usually associated with whole books of the Bible, because each of its books comprises a complete textual unit; however, a book may be internally composed of a variety of styles, forms, and so forth, and thus bear the characteristics of more than one genre (for example, chapter 1 of the Book of Revelation is prophetic/visionary; chapters 2 and 3 are similar to the epistle genre; etc.).",

            "Three Soldiers\nThree Soldiers is a 1921 novel by the American writer and critic John Dos Passos. It is one of the American war novels of the First World War, and remains a classic of the realist war novel genre. H.L. Mencken, then practising primarily as an American literary critic, praised the book in the pages of \"The Smart Set\". \"Until \"Three Soldiers\" is forgotten and fancy achieves its inevitable victory over fact, no war story can be written in the United States without challenging comparison with it\u2014and no story that is less meticulously true will stand up to it. At one blast it disposed of oceans of romance and blather. It changed the whole tone of American opinion about the war; it even changed the recollections of actual veterans of the war. They saw, no doubt, substantially what Dos Passos saw, but it took his bold realism to disentangle their recollections from the prevailing buncombe and sentimentality.\"",
            "Dos (Dos album)\nDos was the debut album recorded by the band Dos. It is a double bass guitar side project for Mike Watt (of the Minutemen and Firehose) and his then-girlfriend (later wife), Kira Roessler (from Black Flag). Formed as a vehicle to take the bass beyond its perceived background role and into the forefront of a band, Dos also became a therapeutic experience in the wake of Roessler's departure from Black Flag and, more tragically, Minutemen D. Boon's sudden death on December 22, 1985. After exchanging demos for the better part of 1986 (Roessler had moved to Connecticut), the duo reconvened to record their self-titled debut late in the year, subsequently releasing it on Watt's own New Alliance Records.",
            "Biblical genre\nA Biblical genre is a classification of Bible literature according to literary genre. The genre of a particular Bible passage is ordinarily identified by analysis of its general writing style, tone, form, structure, literary technique, content, design, and related linguistic factors; texts that exhibit a common set of literary features (very often in keeping with the writing styles of the times in which they were written) are together considered to be belonging to a genre. In Biblical studies, genres are usually associated with whole books of the Bible, because each of its books comprises a complete textual unit; however, a book may be internally composed of a variety of styles, forms, and so forth, and thus bear the characteristics of more than one genre (for example, chapter 1 of the Book of Revelation is prophetic/visionary; chapters 2 and 3 are similar to the epistle genre; etc.).",

            "Revenge tragedy\nRevenge tragedy (less commonly referred to as revenge drama, revenge play, or tragedy of blood) defines a genre of plays made popular in early modern England. Ashley H. Thorndike formally established this genre in his seminal 1902 article \"The Relations of Hamlet to Contemporary Revenge Plays,\" which characterizes revenge tragedy \"as a tragedy whose leading motive is revenge and whose main action deals with the progress of this revenge, leading to the death of the murderers and often the death of the avenger himself.\" Thomas Kyd's \"The Spanish Tragedy\" (c.1580s) is often considered the inaugural revenge tragedy on the early modern stage. However, more recent research extends early modern revenge tragedy to the 1560s with poet and classicist Jasper Heywood's translations of Seneca at Oxford University, including \"Troas\" (1559), \"Thyestes\" (1560), and \"Hercules Furens\" (1561). Additionally, Thomases Norton and Sackville's play \"Gorbuduc\" (1561) is considered an early revenge tragedy (almost twenty years prior to \"The Spanish Tragedy\"). Other well-known revenge tragedies include William Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\" (c.1599-1602) and \"Titus Andronicus\" (c.1588-1593) and Thomas Middleton's \"The Revenger's Tragedy\" (c.1606).",
            "Delhi Sultanate\nThe Delhi Sultanate was a Muslim sultanate based mostly in Delhi that stretched over large parts of the Indian subcontinent for 320 years (1206\u20131526). Five dynasties ruled over the Delhi Sultanate sequentially: the Mamluk dynasty (1206\u201390), the Khalji dynasty (1290\u20131320), the Tughlaq dynasty (1320\u20131414), the Sayyid dynasty (1414\u201351), and the Lodi dynasty (1451\u20131526). Three dynasties (Mamluk, Khalji and Sayyid) were of Turkic origin, one dynasty (Tughlaq) was of Turko-Indian origin, and the last dynasty (Lodi) was of Pashtun origin. The sultanate is noted for being one of the few states to repel an attack by the Mongol Empire, and enthroned one of the few female rulers in Islamic history, Razia Sultana, who reigned from 1236 to 1240.",
            "Chick lit\nChick lit or chick literature is genre fiction, which \"consists of heroine-centered narratives that focus on the trials and tribulations of their individual protagonists\". The genre often addresses issues of modern womanhood \u2013 from romantic relationships to female friendships to matters in the workplace \u2013 in humorous and lighthearted ways. At its onset, chick lit's protagonists tended to be \"single, white, heterosexual, British and American women in their late twenties and early thirties, living in metropolitan areas\". The genre became popular in the late 1990s, with chick lit titles topping bestseller lists and the creation of imprints devoted entirely to chick lit. Chick lit critics generally agree that British author Helen Fielding's \"Bridget Jones's Diary\" (1996) is the \"ur-text\" of chick lit."
