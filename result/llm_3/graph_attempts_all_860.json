The song was later included on the international release of Swift's second studio album, \"Fearless\" (2008), and released as the second pop single from the album in the United Kingdom. It was inspired by Swift's experience with Drew Hardwick, a classmate of hers for whom she had feelings. He was completely unaware and continually spoke about his girlfriend to Swift, something she pretended to be endeared by. Years afterwards, Hardwick appeared at Swift's house, but Swift rejected him. Musically, the track is soft and is primarily guided by a gentle acoustic guitar. Critics have queried the song's classification as country music, with those in agreement (such as Grady Smith of \"Rolling Stone\") citing the themes and narrative style as country-influenced and those opposed (such as Roger Holland of \"PopMatters\") indicating the pop music production and instrumentation lack traditional country elements.",

            "Back to December\n\"Back to December\" is a song written and recorded by American singer/songwriter Taylor Swift for her third studio album \"Speak Now\" (2010). The song was sent to country radio in the United States on November 15, 2010, as the second single from \"Speak Now\". According to Swift, \"Back to December\" is the first time she ever apologizes to someone in a song. Critics speculate that the song is about Taylor Lautner, Swift's ex-boyfriend, which was later acknowledged by Lautner. \"Back to December\" is considered an orchestral country pop ballad and its lyrics are a remorseful plea for forgiveness for breaking up with a former lover."

The song was written by Swift and Liz Rose and produced by Nathan Chapman, with Swift's aid. The song was released on December 7, 2008 by Big Machine Records, as the second single from Swift's second studio album \"Fearless\" (2008).

The song was written by Swift and produced by Nathan Chapman, alongside Swift. It was released on September 12, 2008 by Big Machine Records, as the lead single from Swift's second studio album \"Fearless\" (2008). The song was written about a love interest of Swift's who was not popular among Swift's family and friends. Because of the scenario, Swift related to the plot of William Shakespeare's \"Romeo and Juliet\" (1597) and used it as a source of inspiration to compose the song. However, she replaced \"Romeo and Juliet\"' s original tragic conclusion with a happy ending. It is a midtempo song with a dreamy soprano voice, while the melody continually builds. The lyrics are from the perspective of Juliet.",

            "Teardrops on My Guitar\n\"Teardrops on My Guitar\" is a song by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift.

The song was later included on the international release of Swift's second studio album, \"Fearless\" (2008), and released as the second pop single from the album in the United Kingdom. It was inspired by Swift's experience with Drew Hardwick, a classmate of hers for whom she had feelings. He was completely unaware and continually spoke about his girlfriend to Swift, something she pretended to be endeared by. Years afterwards, Hardwick appeared at Swift's house, but Swift rejected him. Musically, the track is soft and is primarily guided by a gentle acoustic guitar.
