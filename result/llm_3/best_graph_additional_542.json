The first Irish settlers in Saint Paul were soldiers from Fort Snelling, and with the help of Archbishop John Ireland, thousands of Irish immigrants settled in the city. Additionally, the West Seventh neighborhood, also known as the Fort Road area, was historically a Native American and fur trader path along the Mississippi River from downtown Saint Paul to Fort Snelling. Pike Island, part of Fort Snelling State Park, was a portion of the land purchased from the Mdewakanton Sioux Indians by Zebulon Pike, which later became Fort Snelling, Minneapolis, and Saint Paul. The Mendota Bridge, which connects Fort Snelling to Mendota Heights, is the final bridge over the Minnesota River before it flows into the Mississippi River, providing a direct connection to St. Paul.

Additionally, the Fort Road area, which was a historic Native American and fur trader path along the Mississippi River from downtown Saint Paul to Fort Snelling, contributed to the development of the city.\n\nFurthermore, the purchase of land from the Mdewakanton Sioux Indians by Zebulon Pike in 1805, which later became Fort Snelling, Minneapolis, and Saint Paul, demonstrates the historical significance of Fort Snelling in the growth of the region.
