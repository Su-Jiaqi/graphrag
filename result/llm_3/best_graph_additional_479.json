Examples include the dumb show in \"Hamlet\" and the address to the audience by Puck in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\". Another example, in \"The Spanish Tragedy\" by Thomas Kyd, is the introduction to that play by the ghost of Andrea who preps the audience by laying out the story to come.

Examples include the dumb show in \"Hamlet\" and the address to the audience by Puck in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\". Another example, in \"The Spanish Tragedy\" by Thomas Kyd, is the introduction to that play by the ghost of Andrea who preps the audience by laying out the story to come.

Typically, an induction precedes the main text of a play. Inductions are a common feature of plays written and performed in the Renaissance period, including those of Shakespeare. While Shakespeare plays do not typically have inductions, they are sometimes depicted as part of the device of the play within the play. Examples include the dumb show in \"Hamlet\" and the address to the audience by Puck in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\". Another example, in \"The Spanish Tragedy\" by Thomas Kyd, is the introduction to that play by the ghost of Andrea who preps the audience by laying out the story to come.
