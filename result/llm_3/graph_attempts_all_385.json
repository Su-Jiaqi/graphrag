Bond was played by Sean Connery and George Lazenby in the movies shot throughout the 60s. The Bond movies were filmed all across the world and by different directors each time, with some of the old directors collaborating with the new ones.

Each movie recovered its budget and won critically acclaimed awards the years that they came out.

This merger would only last for ten years before the club split back into Sedan Cambrai and Mount Torrens in 1986. The reformed Sedan Cambrai entered the Mid Murray Football Association and played in that competition until it disbanded at the end of the 2009 season when they returned to the Hills Football League Country Division (Division 2). In 2015, Sedan Cambrai was voted out of the Hills Football League Division 2 competition by member clubs and were initially pushed into the C-Grade competition.
