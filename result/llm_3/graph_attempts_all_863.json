This was the second time British India invaded Afghanistan. The war ended after the British emerged victorious against the Afghan rebels and the Afghans agreed to let the British attain all of their geopolitical objectives from the Treaty of Gandamak. Most of the British and Indian soldiers withdrew from Afghanistan.

The emirate emerged from the Durrani Empire, when Dost Mohammed Khan, the founder of the Barakzai dynasty in Kabul, prevailed. The history of the Emirate was dominated by 'the Great Game' between the Russian Empire and the United Kingdom for supremacy in Central Asia. This period was characterized by the expansion of European colonial interests in South Asia. The Emirate of Afghanistan continued the war with the Sikh Empire, which led to the invasion of Afghanistan by British-led Indian forces who completely wiped out the Afghans in 1842 but did not fulfil their initial war objectives. However, during the Second Anglo-Afghan War, the British again defeated the Afghans and this time the British took control of Afghanistan's foreign affairs until Emir Amanullah Khan regained them after the Anglo-Afghan Treaty of 1919 was signed following the Third Anglo-Afghan War.",

This was the second time British India invaded Afghanistan. The war ended after the British emerged victorious against the Afghan rebels and the Afghans agreed to let the British attain all of their geopolitical objectives from the Treaty of Gandamak. Most of the British and Indian soldiers withdrew from Afghanistan. The Afghan tribes were permitted to maintain internal rule and local customs but they had to cede control of the area's foreign relations to the British, who, in turn, guaranteed the area's freedom from foreign military domination as a buffer between the British Raj and the Russian Empire.",

The Islamic State of Afghanistan government remained the internationally recognized government of Afghanistan. The Taliban's Emirate received recognition only from Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates. The defense minister of the Islamic State of Afghanistan, Ahmad Shah Massoud, created the United Front (Northern Alliance) in opposition to the Taliban. The United Front included all Afghan ethnicities: Tajiks, Uzbeks, Hazaras, Turkmens, some Pashtuns and others. During the conflict, the Taliban received military support from Pakistan and financial support from Saudi Arabia.

The emirate emerged from the Durrani Empire, when Dost Mohammed Khan, the founder of the Barakzai dynasty in Kabul, prevailed. The history of the Emirate was dominated by 'the Great Game' between the Russian Empire and the United Kingdom for supremacy in Central Asia. This period was characterized by the expansion of European colonial interests in South Asia. The Emirate of Afghanistan continued the war with the Sikh Empire, which led to the invasion of Afghanistan by British-led Indian forces who completely wiped out the Afghans in 1842 but did not fulfil their initial war objectives. However, during the Second Anglo-Afghan War, the British again defeated the Afghans and this time the British took control of Afghanistan's foreign affairs until Emir Amanullah Khan regained them after the Anglo-Afghan Treaty of 1919 was signed following the Third Anglo-Afghan War.",

This treaty was necessary, because neither the Republic of China nor the People's Republic of China was invited to sign the Treaty of San Francisco due to disagreements by other countries as to which government was the legitimate government of China during and after the Chinese Civil War. Under pressure from the United States, Japan signed a separate peace treaty with the Republic of China to bring the war between the two states to a formal end with a victory for the ROC. Although the ROC itself was not a participant in the San Francisco Peace Conference due to the resumption of the Chinese Civil War after 1945, this treaty largely corresponds to that of San Francisco. In particular, the ROC waived service compensation to Japan in this treaty with respect to Article 14(a).1 of the San Francisco Treaty.",

It was part of the Spring Campaign, fought between 4 and 21 May 1849 and ended with the Hungarian capture of the castle by assault on 21 May. Actually it was the only fortress in the 1848-1849 Hungarian Freedom War, which was taken by the assault of the besieging troops of any of the fighting parts, the others being taken only after agreements between the besiegers and the besieged, with the capitulation of the latters, the capture of Buda on 21 May 1849 by assault being the only exception from this. The siege of Buda was also the shortest siege in the Hungarian Freedom War of 1848-1849 (18 days). The senseless bombardment of Pest by Major General Heinrich Hentzi, the Austrian commander of the city of Pest destroyed the classicist buildings from the shores of the Danube, but the other parts of the capitals also suffered heavy damages because of the artillery duels of the two parts. With the capture of the Buda Castle ended the complete liberation of the Hungarian capital cities (Buda and Pest), and thanks to this the second Hungarian revolutionary Government led by Bertalan Szemere together with Lajos Kossuth, the Governor-President of Hungary returned from Debrecen the interim capital of the Hungarian revolution, in the real capital of Hungary. At 21 May 1849, the same day with the capture of Buda, the two emperors: Franz Joseph I of Austria and tsar Nicholas I of Russia signed the final treaty which decided the involvement of 200 000 Russian soldiers (and a 80 000 strong reserve force, in the case that they were needed) in Hungary, in order to help the Habsburg Empire to crush the Hungarian revolution.",

It was a military conflict that took place between 1630 and 1635, during the course of the Thirty Years' War. It was a major turning point of the war, as during this time, the Protestant cause, previously on the verge of defeat, won several major victories and snatched victory away from the Habsburg-Catholic coalition. It is often considered to be an independent conflict by most historians.",

            "Military history of the Mi'kmaq people\nMi\u2019kmaq militias were made up of Mi\u2019kmaq warriors (Sm\u00e1knisk) who worked independently as well as in coordination with the Wabanaki Confederacy, French and Acadian forces throughout the colonial period to defend their homeland Mi\u2019kma\u2019ki against the English (the British after 1707). The Mi'kmaq militias deployed effective resistance for over 75 years before treaties were created and the Burial of the Hatchet Ceremony took place (1761). In the nineteenth century, the Mi'kmaq \"boasted\" that, in their contest with the British, the Mi'kmaq \"killed more men than they lost\". In 1753, Charles Morris stated that the Mi'kmaq have the advantage of \"no settlement or place of abode, but wandering from place to place in unknown and, therefore, inaccessible woods, is so great that it has hitherto rendered all attempts to surprise them ineffectual\". Leadership on both sides of the conflict employed standard colonial warfare, which included scalping non-combatants (e.g., families). After some engagements against the British during the American Revolution, the militias were dormant throughout the nineteenth century, while the Mi'kmaq people used diplomatic efforts to have the local authorities honour the treaties. After confederation, Mi\u2019kmaq warriors eventually joined the Canadian war efforts in World War I and World War II. The most well-known colonial leaders of these militias were Chief (sakamaw) Jean-Baptiste Cope and Chief \u00c9tienne B\u00e2tard.",

At the beginning of the conflict, British forces had defeated the forces of Afghan Emir Dost Mohammad Barakzai and in 1839 occupied Kabul, restoring the former ruler, Shah Shujah Durrani, as emir. However a deteriorating situation made their position more and more precarious, until an uprising in Kabul forced the then commander, Major General Sir William Elphinstone, to withdraw the garrison. To this end he negotiated an agreement with Wazir Akbar Khan, one of the sons of Dost Mohammad Barakzai, by which his army was to fall back to the British garrison at Jalalabad, more than 90 mi away. As the army and its numerous dependents and camp-followers began its march, it came under attack from Afghan tribesmen. Many of the column died of exposure, frostbite or starvation or were killed during the fighting.",
            "2010 Northern Hemisphere summer heat waves\nThe 2010 Northern Hemisphere summer heat waves included severe heat waves that impacted most of the United States, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, China, Hong Kong, North Africa and the European continent as a whole, along with parts of Canada, Russia, Indochina, South Korea and Japan during May, June, July, and August 2010. The first phase of the global heatwaves was caused by a moderate El Ni\u00f1o event, which lasted from June 2009 to May 2010. The first phase lasted only from April 2010 to June 2010, and caused only moderate above average temperatures in the areas affected. But it also set new record high temperatures for most of the area affected, in the Northern Hemisphere. The second phase (the main, and most devastating phase) was caused by a very strong La Ni\u00f1a event, which lasted from June 2010 to June 2011. According to meteorologists, the 2010\u201311 La Ni\u00f1a event was one of the strongest La Ni\u00f1a events ever observed. That same La Ni\u00f1a event also had devastating effects in the Eastern states of Australia. The second phase lasted from June 2010 to October 2010, caused severe heat waves, and multiple record-breaking temperatures. The heatwaves began on April 2010, when strong anticyclones began to develop, over most of the affected regions, in the Northern Hemisphere. The heatwaves ended in October 2010, when the powerful anticyclones over most of the affected areas dissipated."

The United Front included all Afghan ethnicities: Tajiks, Uzbeks, Hazaras, Turkmens, some Pashtuns and others. During the conflict, the Taliban received military support from Pakistan and financial support from Saudi Arabia.

The emirate emerged from the Durrani Empire, when Dost Mohammed Khan, the founder of the Barakzai dynasty in Kabul, prevailed. The history of the Emirate was dominated by 'the Great Game' between the Russian Empire and the United Kingdom for supremacy in Central Asia. This period was characterized by the expansion of European colonial interests in South Asia. The Emirate of Afghanistan continued the war with the Sikh Empire, which led to the invasion of Afghanistan by British-led Indian forces who completely wiped out the Afghans in 1842 but did not fulfil their initial war objectives. However, during the Second Anglo-Afghan War, the British again defeated the Afghans and this time the British took control of Afghanistan's foreign affairs until Emir Amanullah Khan regained them after the Anglo-Afghan Treaty of 1919 was signed following the Third Anglo-Afghan War.",

            "2010 Northern Hemisphere summer heat waves\nThe 2010 Northern Hemisphere summer heat waves included severe heat waves that impacted most of the United States, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, China, Hong Kong, North Africa and the European continent as a whole, along with parts of Canada, Russia, Indochina, South Korea and Japan during May, June, July, and August 2010. The first phase of the global heatwaves was caused by a moderate El Ni\u00f1o event, which lasted from June 2009 to May 2010. The first phase lasted only from April 2010 to June 2010, and caused only moderate above average temperatures in the areas affected. But it also set new record high temperatures for most of the area affected, in the Northern Hemisphere. The second phase (the main, and most devastating phase) was caused by a very strong La Ni\u00f1a event, which lasted from June 2010 to June 2011. According to meteorologists, the 2010\u201311 La Ni\u00f1a event was one of the strongest La Ni\u00f1a events ever observed. That same La Ni\u00f1a event also had devastating effects in the Eastern states of Australia. The second phase lasted from June 2010 to October 2010, caused severe heat waves, and multiple record-breaking temperatures. The heatwaves began on April 2010, when strong anticyclones began to develop, over most of the affected regions, in the Northern Hemisphere.

            "The military conflict between the British Raj and the Emirate of Afghanistan from 1878 to 1880 is known as the Second Anglo-Afghan War. This war ended with the British emerging victorious against the Afghan rebels, leading to the Afghans agreeing to let the British attain all of their geopolitical objectives from the Treaty of Gandamak. This conflict was part of the wider history of the Emirate of Afghanistan, which was dominated by 'the Great Game' between the Russian Empire and the United Kingdom for supremacy in Central Asia. The war resulted in the British taking control of Afghanistan's foreign affairs until Emir Amanullah Khan regained them after the Anglo-Afghan Treaty of 1919 was signed following the Third Anglo-Afghan War.",
            "The Second Anglo-Afghan War can be divided into two main phases. The first phase began in November 1878 when Great Britain, concerned about Russian influence in Afghanistan, invaded the country from British India. This phase ended in May 1879 with the Treaty of Gandamak, which allowed the Afghans to maintain internal sovereignty but forced them to cede control over their foreign policy to the British. The second phase began in September 1879 after an anti-British uprising in Kabul and concluded in September 1880 with the decisive Battle of Kandahar, in which the British emerged victorious against the Afghan rebels. The war resulted in the Treaty of Gandamak, which allowed the British to attain their geopolitical objectives and control Afghanistan's foreign relations. The Emirate of Afghanistan, ruled by the Barakzai dynasty, was a key player in this conflict, and the war ultimately led to the British taking control of Afghanistan's foreign affairs until Emir Amanullah Khan regained them after the Anglo-Afghan Treaty of 1919.",
            "The event or agreement that officially ended the first phase of the Second Anglo-Afghan War was the Treaty of Gandamak. This treaty was signed in May 1879 and permitted the Afghans to maintain internal sovereignty while ceding control over their foreign policy to the British. This marked the end of the initial phase of the conflict, with fighting resuming in September 1879.",
            "The Treaty of Gandamak, which officially ended the first phase of the Second Anglo-Afghan War, had significant historical implications. It marked the end of the initial phase of the conflict, which began in 1878 when Great Britain invaded Afghanistan from British India due to concerns about growing Russian influence in the region. The treaty allowed the Afghans to maintain internal sovereignty but forced them to cede control over their foreign policy to the British. This agreement also led to the withdrawal of most British and Indian soldiers from Afghanistan.\n\nThe Treaty of Gandamak was a crucial event in the context of the Second Anglo-Afghan War, which was a military conflict fought between the British Raj and the Emirate of Afghanistan from 1878 to 1880. The war ended with the British emerging victorious against the Afghan rebels, and the Afghans agreeing to let the British attain all of their geopolitical objectives from the treaty. This included the Afghans ceding control of the area's foreign relations to the British, who guaranteed the area's freedom from foreign military domination as a buffer between the British Raj and the Russian Empire.\n\nThe treaty also had implications for the Emirate of Afghanistan, which was an emirate between Central Asia and South Asia. The history of the Emirate was dominated by 'the Great Game' between the Russian Empire and the United Kingdom for supremacy in Central Asia. The Treaty of Gandamak allowed the British to control Afghanistan's foreign affairs until Emir Amanullah Khan regained them after the Anglo-Afghan Treaty of 1919 was signed following the Third Anglo-Afghan War.\n\nFurthermore, the treaty had implications for the Barakzai dynasty, which ruled modern-day Afghanistan from 1826 to 1973. During this era, Afghanistan saw much of its territory lost to the British, Persia, and Russia, as well as internal conflicts and civil war.\n\nIn conclusion, the Treaty of Gandamak had significant historical implications as it marked the end of the first phase of the Second Anglo-Afghan War, reshaped the geopolitical landscape of the region, and had lasting effects on the governance and sovereignty of Afghanistan.",
            "The ending of the first phase of the Second Anglo-Afghan War with the signing of the Treaty of Gandamak had a significant impact on the continuation and resolution of the overall conflict. The treaty allowed the British to control Afghanistan's foreign policy, effectively giving them a level of influence and power over the region. This reshaped the geopolitical landscape of the area and had lasting effects on the governance and sovereignty of Afghanistan.\n\nThe treaty also had implications for the Emirate of Afghanistan, as it allowed the British to maintain control over the country's foreign affairs until Emir Amanullah Khan regained them after the Anglo-Afghan Treaty of 1919. This shows that the ending of the first phase of the war had a direct impact on the future governance and sovereignty of Afghanistan.\n\nFurthermore, the treaty had implications for the Barakzai dynasty, as it marked a significant loss of territory and influence for the ruling family. This loss of territory and influence had lasting effects on the internal conflicts and civil war within Afghanistan.\n\nOverall, the ending of the first phase of the Second Anglo-Afghan War with the signing of the Treaty of Gandamak had a profound impact on the continuation and resolution of the overall conflict. It reshaped the geopolitical landscape of the region, had lasting effects on the governance and sovereignty of Afghanistan, and had implications for the ruling dynasty."
