The game is a variation of Deuces Wild and is based on five card draw where the player is dealt a five card hand. The player can then choose which cards to keep or discard and is dealt new cards accordingly. The payoff is based on the value of the hand. The \"wild card\" is announced before the hand is dealt and can be substituted for any card in the deck according to what is most beneficial to the player's hand. Since the game uses a standard deck, there are always four \"wild cards\" in play. This allows the player greater flexibility in building a winning hand.",
            "I Love to Laugh\n\"I Love to Laugh\", also called \"We Love to Laugh\", is a song from Walt Disney's film \"Mary Poppins\". It was composed by Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman. The song is sung in the film by \"Uncle Albert\" (Ed Wynn), and \"Bert\" (Dick Van Dyke) as they levitate uncontrollably toward the ceiling, eventually joined by Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews) herself. The premise of the scene, that laughter and happiness cause Uncle Albert (and like-minded visitors) to float into the air, can be seen as a metaphor for the way laughter can \"lighten\" a mood. (Compare Peter Pan's flight power, which is also powered by happy thoughts.) Conversely, thinking of something sad literally brings Albert and his visitors \"down to earth\" again. The song states a case strongly in favor of laughter, even if Mary Poppins appears to disapprove of Uncle Albert's behavior, especially since it not only complicates the task of getting Albert down, but the infectious mood sends Bert and the Banks children into the air as well.",

The premise of the scene, that laughter and happiness cause Uncle Albert (and like-minded visitors) to float into the air, can be seen as a metaphor for the way laughter can \"lighten\" a mood. (Compare Peter Pan's flight power, which is also powered by happy thoughts.) Conversely, thinking of something sad literally brings Albert and his visitors \"down to earth\" again.

It was written by band members Amy Heidemann and Nick Noonan, as well as Elite and producer John \"Jon Jon Traxx\" Webb, Jr. The song features a primary hip hop influence, as well as elements of rock, electronica and ska. The song debuted live on \"Saturday Night Live\" on February 11, 2012. Heidemann and Noonan first performed a live acoustic snippet of the song on Elvis Duran and the Morning Show prior to their SNL appearance. \"I Told You So\" is said to pay homage to Chris Brown's \"Look at Me Now\", a song they covered on YouTube that brought them to fame.",
            "Anything's Wild\nAnything's Wild is a video poker game that allows the player to select any card (by rank) to act as the \"wild card\". The game is a variation of Deuces Wild and is based on five card draw where the player is dealt a five card hand. The player can then choose which cards to keep or discard and is dealt new cards accordingly. The payoff is based on the value of the hand. The \"wild card\" is announced before the hand is dealt and can be substituted for any card in the deck according to what is most beneficial to the player's hand. Since the game uses a standard deck, there are always four \"wild cards\" in play. This allows the player greater flexibility in building a winning hand.",
            "I Love to Laugh\n\"I Love to Laugh\", also called \"We Love to Laugh\", is a song from Walt Disney's film \"Mary Poppins\". It was composed by Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman. The song is sung in the film by \"Uncle Albert\" (Ed Wynn), and \"Bert\" (Dick Van Dyke) as they levitate uncontrollably toward the ceiling, eventually joined by Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews) herself. The premise of the scene, that laughter and happiness cause Uncle Albert (and like-minded visitors) to float into the air, can be seen as a metaphor for the way laughter can \"lighten\" a mood. (Compare Peter Pan's flight power, which is also powered by happy thoughts.) Conversely, thinking of something sad literally brings Albert and his visitors \"down to earth\" again. The song states a case strongly in favor of laughter, even if Mary Poppins appears to disapprove of Uncle Albert's behavior, especially since it not only complicates the task of getting Albert down, but the infectious mood sends Bert and the Banks children into the air as well.",

            "Publication bias\nPublication bias is a type of bias that occurs in published academic research. It occurs when the outcome of an experiment or research study influences the decision whether to publish or otherwise distribute it. Publication bias matters because literature reviews regarding support for a hypothesis can be biased if the original literature is contaminated by publication bias. Publishing only results that show a significant finding disturbs the balance of findings.",
