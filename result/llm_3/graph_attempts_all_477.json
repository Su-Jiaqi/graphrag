He and his family were interned in Douglas on the Isle of Man during the Second World War. He began his career working for Filippo Del Giudice and Two Cities Films. When Two Cities was absorbed into the Rank Organisation in the mid-1940s Coen was employed by Sir David Cunynghame of London Film Productions as a subtitler. As Coen later described it in an interview, he did not know anything about subtitling at the time, and learned on the job: I finally got a phone call from London Films, Sir Cunnyngham, that 's it, who asked me whether I had ever subtitles pictures. I immediately said I had when in point of fact I did not know what he meant, and there was a young man in the office with Sir David Cunnynghame called Lew Watt, and he said Lew Watt will do the technical side and we want you to subtitle an Italian picture in to English. I said certainly . I came out of his office and Lew Watt said to me you don't know what they're talking about do you, I said you're quite right, he said well I'll show you. And I started subtitling pictures with Lew Watt, I used to do the literary side, and he used to do the technical side, the spotting, and lengths, and we together did subtitles for 40 or 50 pictures. The funny thing was we subtitled pictures in Chinese, in Indian and for the Chinese picture I had to have a Chinese waiter with me to tell me where the subtitles [...] I had the Italian dialogue and I had the picture, they gave me a film and we did the spotting together with Lew Watt and the measurements and I used to type the script. We had the film, we had the print which used to run on the two sided thing. And Lew Watt was working all the day so we had to do this at night, so we either used to work at night till 2 o'clock in the morning or we used to work at the weekends. There was always the problem that the Movieola might break down and so we had spare keys of other cutting rooms in in elm St in case we were caught. And that was how we started.Coen later founded his own company Kenilworth Film Productions and spent most of the post-war years producing second features. He made a dozen films in partnership with the director Charles Saunders. He later produced the 1971 horror film \"Burke & Hare\" and the comedies \"Au Pair Girls\" and \"Intimate Games.\"",

Other variations include the \"barrel roll\" where the roll is completed inside the barrel, and the \"rollo takeoff\" which is performed while catching the wave. This trick was named by someone in the industry. I remember the story where Pat Caldwell did the roll and Jack Lindholm or whoever saw him do it and commented \"what do you call that an el rollo\".

It was discovered in February of the year 1956, ten years after the initial discovery of the scrolls. It was purchased by The Palestine Archaeological Museum located in Jerusalem and first unrolled in November 1961. Four fragments of this scroll were later purchased by the same museum. The scroll\u2019s physical make up is that of dark yellow animal hide and is a little less than 1\u00a0mm thick. The primary body of the manuscript consists of \u201c5 sheets of leather, still sewn together\u201d, and is 4.253 meters in length. It is estimated to have been copied anywhere from 30-50 C.E., and is written in Biblical style Hebrew. When rolled out, it forms a slight arc, and the top part is clean and well kept, while the bottom is decomposing significantly. It was first edited and published by James A.

            "Microleter\nMicroleter is an extinct genus of parareptile which existed in Oklahoma during the Early Permian period. It was first named by paleontologists Linda A. Tsuji, Johannes Muller, and Robert R. Reisz in 2010. The type species is \"Microleter mckinzieorum\". A very well preserved skull and lower jaw is the only known specimen. It was found from the Early Permian (early Kungurian stage) fissure-fill deposits near Richards Spur in Comanche County, often referred to as the Fort Sill locality. The Fort Sill locality has yielded many other well preserved tetrapod fossils, including those of other parareptiles such as \"Bolosaurus\", \"Colobomycter\", and \"Delorhynchus\"."

He is best known for his discovery, on December 10, 2000, of Selam, also referred to as \u201cLucy\u2019s child\u201d, the almost-complete fossilized remains of a 3.3 million year old child of the species \"Australopithecus afarensis\". The \u201cworld\u2019s oldest child\u201d, she is the most complete skeleton of a human ancestor discovered to date. Selam represents a milestone in our understanding of human and pre-human evolution and contributes significantly to our understanding of the biology and childhood of early species in the human lineage; a subject about which we have very little information.

            "Neighbourhood\nA neighbourhood (British English), or neighborhood (American English; see spelling differences), is a geographically localised community within a larger city, town, suburb or rural area. Neighbourhoods are often social communities with considerable face-to-face interaction among members. Researchers have not agreed on an exact definition, but the following may serve as a starting point: \"\u2026Neighbourhood is generally defined spatially as a specific geographic area and functionally as a set of social networks. Neighbourhoods, then, are the spatial units in which face-to-face social interactions occur\u2014the personal settings and situations where residents seek to realise common values, socialise youth, and maintain effective social control.\"",
            "Grace After Midnight\nAccording to the memoir, Pearson says her life was turned around upon learning in prison that a close friend and drug dealer, whom she called \"Uncle\", was killed. Pearson said of her decision to write her book, \"I just want to let people know where I came from ... to share my story. I know the Lord has blessed me. He gave me the power just to tell this story.\" The book also depicts the difficulty with which Pearson attempts to adjust to life after prison; she is fired from two jobs due to her criminal background, which drives her to return temporarily to drug dealing. During an interview about the book, she said, \"Every time I turned around, they kept firing me, so where else could I turn to? The streets never let you down. That's sad to say, but what (was) I supposed to be, starving? Go to a shelter?\"",
            "Guido Coen\nGuido Coen (1915\u20132010) was an Italian-born British film producer and film subtitler. He and his family were interned in Douglas on the Isle of Man during the Second World War. He began his career working for Filippo Del Giudice and Two Cities Films. When Two Cities was absorbed into the Rank Organisation in the mid-1940s Coen was employed by Sir David Cunynghame of London Film Productions as a subtitler. As Coen later described it in an interview, he did not know anything about subtitling at the time, and learned on the job: I finally got a phone call from London Films, Sir Cunnyngham, that 's it, who asked me whether I had ever subtitles pictures. I immediately said I had when in point of fact I did not know what he meant, and there was a young man in the office with Sir David Cunnynghame called Lew Watt, and he said Lew Watt will do the technical side and we want you to subtitle an Italian picture in to English. I said certainly . I came out of his office and Lew Watt said to me you don't know what they're talking about do you, I said you're quite right, he said well I'll show you. And I started subtitling pictures with Lew Watt, I used to do the literary side, and he used to do the technical side, the spotting, and lengths, and we together did subtitles for 40 or 50 pictures. The funny thing was we subtitled pictures in Chinese, in Indian and for the Chinese picture I had to have a Chinese waiter with me to tell me where the subtitles [...] I had the Italian dialogue and I had the picture, they gave me a film and we did the spotting together with Lew Watt and the measurements and I used to type the script. We had the film, we had the print which used to run on the two sided thing. And Lew Watt was working all the day so we had to do this at night, so we either used to work at night till 2 o'clock in the morning or we used to work at the weekends. There was always the problem that the Movieola might break down and so we had spare keys of other cutting rooms in in elm St in case we were caught. And that was how we started.Coen later founded his own company Kenilworth Film Productions and spent most of the post-war years producing second features. He made a dozen films in partnership with the director Charles Saunders. He later produced the 1971 horror film \"Burke & Hare\" and the comedies \"Au Pair Girls\" and \"Intimate Games.\"",

Otto Hahn and Meitner led the small group of scientists who first discovered nuclear fission of uranium when it absorbed an extra neutron; the results were published in early 1939. Meitner and Otto Frisch understood that the fission process, which splits the atomic nucleus of uranium into two smaller nuclei, must be accompanied by an enormous release of energy. This process is the basis of the nuclear weapons that were developed in the U.S. during World War II and used against Japan in 1945. Nuclear fission is also the process exploited by nuclear reactors to generate electricity.",

            "National Mine Map Repository\nThe National Mine Map Repository (NMMR) is part of the United States Department of the Interior (DOI), Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE or OSM). The NMMR resides in the Pittsburgh suburb of Green Tree, Pennsylvania, and collects and maintains mine map information and images for the entire country, including data and maps of coal mines in the anthracite coal region of northeastern Pennsylvania. The Green Tree facility provides and stores, digitally and in microfilm (aperture cards), over 182,000 maps of abandoned mines. This repository contains maps of mine workings from the 1790s to the present day. It serves as a point of reference for mine maps and other information for both surface and underground mines throughout the United States. It also serves as a location to retrieve mine maps in an emergency. The NMMR provides services ranging from retrieving mine related data for economic analysis to assessing the potential risk associated with underground mining. Through analysis of mine maps and related information, the repository assists private and public sectors in industrial and commercial development, highway construction, and the preservation of public health, safety, and welfare. In addition, they collect, reproduce, and maintain a national inventory of mine maps and supporting documentation for private and public interests."

            "The well-preserved helmet that was discovered in 1939 is the Sutton Hoo helmet. It is an eighth-century Anglo-Saxon helmet found during the excavation of the Sutton Hoo ship burial and is widely believed to have been the helmet of King R\u00e6dwald of East Anglia. It is considered one of the most important Anglo-Saxon artifacts ever found and is known for its elaborate decoration, which may have given it a secondary function akin to a crown.",

            "The Coppergate Helmet, also known as the York Helmet, is an eighth-century Anglo-Saxon helmet found in York. It is one of only six Anglo-Saxon helmets discovered to date, along with the Benty Grange, Pioneer, Shorwell, Sutton Hoo, and Staffordshire helmets. The Sutton Hoo helmet, discovered in 1939, is widely believed to have been the helmet of King R\u00e6dwald of East Anglia and is considered one of the most important Anglo-Saxon artifacts ever found. The Pioneer Helmet, found in Northamptonshire, is similar in design to the Coppergate Helmet but is larger and likely had two cheek plates and a nasal. The Shorwell helmet, found on the Isle of Wight, is also one of the six known Anglo-Saxon helmets. The Staffordshire helmet, discovered in 2009, is part of the largest discovery of contemporary gold and silver metalwork in Britain and is only the sixth known Anglo-Saxon helmet. These helmets provide valuable insights into Anglo-Saxon history and craftsmanship.",
            "The comparison of the helmet discovered in 1939 with the Coppergate Helmet reveals that the Sutton Hoo helmet, discovered in 1939, is widely believed to have been the helmet of King R\u00e6dwald of East Anglia. This association with royalty suggests that the ownership of the Sutton Hoo helmet is linked to a prominent historical figure. In contrast, the Coppergate Helmet's owner/associated person is listed as unknown, indicating that there is no direct association with a specific individual of historical significance. Additionally, the Pioneer Helmet, which is similar in design to the Coppergate Helmet, is larger and likely had two cheek plates and a nasal. This suggests that the design and construction of these helmets may have been influenced by similar cultural and technological factors. Overall, while the ownership of the Sutton Hoo helmet is linked to royalty, the ownership of the Coppergate Helmet remains unknown, and its design is comparable to the Pioneer Helmet.",
            "The helmet discovered in 1939 at Sutton Hoo is widely believed to have belonged to King R\u00e6dwald of East Anglia, indicating a direct association with royalty. In contrast, the Coppergate Helmet's owner is unknown, suggesting no direct association with a specific historical figure. The design and construction of the Coppergate Helmet are comparable to the Pioneer Helmet, indicating potential cultural and technological influences. Therefore, the helmet discovered in 1939 is associated with King R\u00e6dwald, while the Coppergate Helmet's owner remains unknown."
