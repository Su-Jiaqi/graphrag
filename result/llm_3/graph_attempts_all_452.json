Recording the album was problematic and spanned an entire year: Phil Spector produced sessions in October 1973 at A&M Studios, and Lennon produced sessions in October 1974 at Record Plant Studios (East). Lennon was being sued by Morris Levy over copyright infringement of one line in his song \"Come Together\". As part of an agreement, Lennon had to include three Levy-owned songs on \"Rock 'n' Roll\". Spector disappeared with the session recordings and was subsequently involved in a motor accident, leaving the album's tracks unrecoverable until the beginning of the \"Walls and Bridges\" sessions.

It is one of few current albums that Ringo Starr has released on a major label, this one being released on Universal Music Group, as well as his 2008 studio album \"Liverpool 8\", which was released under Capitol Records. One of the reasons that this particular live album might have been released on a more popular label is because the Greek Theatre (located in Los Angeles) is more of a bigger venue then some of Ringo's other concert locations. The album oddly removes many of the songs that were sung at the concert. On the filmed concert, also included with the CD, there are several more songs. Such examples are Edgar Winter's \"Frankenstein\" and what would have been an obvious choice for the album, a live version of Ringo Starr's \"Liverpool 8\" song.

The lyrics reflect Harrison's uneasy feelings towards the Beatles' legacy, three years after the group's break-up, and serve as his statement of independence from expectations raised by the band's unprecedented popularity. Some music critics and biographers suggest that he wrote the song during a period of personal anguish, following the acclaim he had received as a solo artist with the 1970 triple album \"All Things Must Pass\" and his 1971\u201372 Bangladesh aid project. The revelatory nature of the lyrics has encouraged comparisons between \"Living in the Material World\" and John Lennon's primal therapy-inspired 1970 release, \"Plastic Ono Band\"."

The original genus name was \"Nemegtia\", but this was changed to \"Nemegtomaia\" in 2005, as the former name was preoccupied. The first part of the generic name refers to the Nemegt Basin, where the animal was found, and the second part means \"good mother\", in reference to the fact that oviraptorids are known to have brooded their eggs. The specific name honours the palaeontologist Rinchen Barsbold. Two more specimens were found in 2007, one of which was found on top of a nest with eggs, but the dinosaur had received its genus name before it was found associated with eggs."

            "Imagine (John Lennon album)\nImagine is the second studio album by John Lennon. Recorded and released in 1971, the album is more heavily produced in contrast to the basic, raw arrangements of his previous album, the critically acclaimed \"John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band\".",
            "I'm Losing You (John Lennon song)\n\"I'm Losing You\" is a song written by John Lennon and released on his 1980 album \"Double Fantasy\". It was completed in Bermuda in June 1980, after Lennon failed at an attempted telephone call to Yoko Ono. The song is also available on the 1982 compilation \"The John Lennon Collection\", the 1998 boxset \"John Lennon Anthology\", the one disc compilation \"Wonsaponatime\", the 2005 two disc compilation \"\" and in 2010 for the \"Gimme Some Truth\" album. The song was also featured in the 2005 musical \"Lennon\".",
            "Hold On (John Lennon song)\n\"Hold On\" is a song from the album \"John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band\" by John Lennon. It features only vocals, tremolo guitar, drums, and bass guitar, typical of the sparse arrangements Lennon favoured at the time. On the 2000 reissue of \"John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band\", \"Hold On\" features a slightly longer introduction. The original version was restored on the 2010 reissue.",

Because neither collection spanned Lennon's releases up to and including 1984's \"Milk and Honey\", \"Lennon Legend: The Very Best of John Lennon\" \u2013 considered the definitive Lennon retrospective \u2013 was compiled to rectify the situation. It was released in the UK in 1997 through Parlophone and early 1998 in the US by EMI Records.",
            "Life Begins at 40 (song)\n\"Life Begins at 40\" is a song by John Lennon. It was written in 1980, the year that both Lennon and Ringo Starr turned 40 years of age. Lennon recorded a demo of the song at his home, but it was not recorded at any of the sessions for his comeback album, \"Double Fantasy.\" Instead, he intended to give the song to Starr to record on his own forthcoming album, \"Can't Fight Lightning.\" The song's amiable country feel was well suited to Starr's singing style. After Lennon's murder in December 1980, those plans were shelved. However, Lennon's demo was eventually issued in 1998 on the \"John Lennon Anthology\" box set.",

Following the compilation \"The John Lennon Collection\", it is Lennon's eighth and final studio album, and the first posthumous release of new Lennon music, having been recorded in the last months of his life during and following the sessions for their 1980 album \"Double Fantasy\". It was assembled by Yoko Ono in association with the Geffen label.",
            "Rock 'n' Roll (John Lennon album)\nRock 'n' Roll is the sixth studio album by John Lennon. Released in 1975, it is an album of late 1950s and early 1960s songs as covered by Lennon. Recording the album was problematic and spanned an entire year: Phil Spector produced sessions in October 1973 at A&M Studios, and Lennon produced sessions in October 1974 at Record Plant Studios (East). Lennon was being sued by Morris Levy over copyright infringement of one line in his song \"Come Together\". As part of an agreement, Lennon had to include three Levy-owned songs on \"Rock 'n' Roll\". Spector disappeared with the session recordings and was subsequently involved in a motor accident, leaving the album's tracks unrecoverable until the beginning of the \"Walls and Bridges\" sessions. With \"Walls and Bridges\" coming out first, featuring one Levy-owned song, Levy sued Lennon expecting to see Lennon's \"Rock 'n' Roll\" album.",

In the Philippines Apple Records released \"Isolation\" as the b-side to \"Mother\", the single off \"John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band\", in contrast to most countries where the b-side was Yoko Ono's \"Why.\" It was also released on an EP in Mexico along with \"Mother,\" \"Look at Me'\" and \"My Mummy's Dead.\"",
