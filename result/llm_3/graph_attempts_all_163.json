            "Lophodermium\nLophodermium is a genus of fungi within the family Rhytismataceae. The genus contains 145 species and has a global distribution. Species of this genus are usually observed producing zone lines, conidiomata and ascomata on dead fallen leaves, but at least some are known to colonize living leaves. In many cases they then live inside the colonized leaf as a symptomless endobiont, where they are regarded as detritivores utilising dead plant matter. In a few cases they may kill all or part of the leaf prematurely, and there is a substantial literature dealing with those species as plant pathogens. The genus infects many different plant families but with a notable concentration in the family Pinaceae; many \"Lophodermium\" species are restricted to a single host genus (or even species), but some, particularly those infecting grasses, may infect several genera. Some are economically important plant pathogens, such as those that cause needlecast disease in European Black Pine, Scots Pine and Red Pine in forestry and christmas tree plantations. In these species, notably \"L. pinastri\" and \"L. seditiosum\", the fungal spores disperse and infect the pine needles in late summer, which turn brown by the following spring and then fall off.",

This term derives from the writings of the ancient geographer Pomponius Mela and Ptolemy, where it meant the geographical description of regions. However, its resonances of meaning have varied at different times. Richard Helgerson states that \"chorography defines itself by opposition to chronicle.

Chick flicks often are released \"en masse\" around Valentine's Day. The equivalent for male audiences is the guy-cry film. Feminists such as Gloria Steinem have objected to terms such as \"chick flick\" and the related term \"chick lit\" and a film critic has called the term \"chick flick\" derogatory.",

The terms refer to any news story or article whose main focus is describing how a particular candidate or candidates is faring during the election, in other words, trying to predict the outcome. This category includes polls. There is a thin line between a horse race news story and a non horse race news story. For example, an article simply describing a candidate's economic policy is a non horse race article, but an article which is about how certain groups of voters are angry at a candidate's economic policy is a horse race article.",

This causes preferential selection when finding their anemone host species. Although popular, maintaining this species in captivity is rather complex. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority regulates the number of collection permits that are issued to aquarium fish dealers who seek this, and other tropical fish within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park.",

            "The term specifically coined by CREEM to describe a genre of rock is \"punk rock\".",
            "Gene Sculatti's writing for CREEM does relate to the coining of the famous term \"punk rock.\" As a writer for CREEM during the 1970s, Sculatti would have been part of the cultural and musical scene that was witnessing the emergence of punk rock as a genre. His writing likely contributed to the discussion and promotion of punk rock, and may have played a role in popularizing the term. This context of the time period, with the rebellious and anti-establishment attitudes of the 1970s, would have been influential in the development and popularization of punk rock as a genre."
