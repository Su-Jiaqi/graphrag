Critic Ginette Vincendeau defined the films made by Beineix and others as \"youth-oriented films with high production values...The \"look\" of the \"cin\u00e9ma du look\" refers to the films' high investment in non-naturalistic, self-conscious aesthetics, notably intense colours and lighting effects. Their spectacular (studio based) and technically brilliant \"mise-en-sc\u00e8ne\" is usually put to the service of romantic plots.\" The \"cin\u00e9ma du look\" included the films of Luc Besson and L\u00e9os Carax. Luc Besson, like Beineix, was much maligned by the critical establishment during the 1980s, while Carax was much admired. In late 2006, Beineix published a first volume of his autobiography, \"Les Chantiers de la gloire\" (in French only). The title alluded to the French title of Stanley Kubrick's film, \"Les Sentiers de la gloire\" (\"Paths of Glory\").",
            "Chick flick\nChick flick is a slang term for the film genre dealing mainly with love and romance which is targeted to a female audience. It can be specifically defined as a genre in which a woman is the protagonist. Although many types of films may be directed toward the female gender, \"chick flick\" is typically used only in reference to films that contain emotion or themes that are relationship-based (although not necessarily romantic as films may focus on parent-child or friend relationships). Chick flicks often are released \"en masse\" around Valentine's Day. The equivalent for male audiences is the guy-cry film. Feminists such as Gloria Steinem have objected to terms such as \"chick flick\" and the related term \"chick lit\" and a film critic has called the term \"chick flick\" derogatory.",
