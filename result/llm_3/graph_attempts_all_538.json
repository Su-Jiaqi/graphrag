            "Anything's Wild\nAnything's Wild is a video poker game that allows the player to select any card (by rank) to act as the \"wild card\". The game is a variation of Deuces Wild and is based on five card draw where the player is dealt a five card hand. The player can then choose which cards to keep or discard and is dealt new cards accordingly. The payoff is based on the value of the hand. The \"wild card\" is announced before the hand is dealt and can be substituted for any card in the deck according to what is most beneficial to the player's hand. Since the game uses a standard deck, there are always four \"wild cards\" in play. This allows the player greater flexibility in building a winning hand.",
            "Digital Media Academy\nDigital Media Academy (commonly referred to as \"DMA\") is a digital art and technology training company, located in Los Gatos, CA, offering Stanford University Continuing Studies accredited courses for adults as well as summer camp programs for kids, age 6-18, tech camps at several universities in the US and Canada. DMA was officially incorporated in 2002, but was incubated at Stanford University in the late 1990s as the Academy for New Media, a program of Stanford's Academic Computing department. The Academy for New Media was created at Stanford in 1999 as an outreach to K-12 educators and high-school students interested in learning the latest digital media software tools from award-winning creative professionals. In Fall 2001, the Academy for New Media fell victim to University budget cuts and the program was transitioned away from Stanford to a private entity \u2013 and Digital Media Academy was born. The Stanford University Continuing Studies department has continued to offer CEU credit through Digital Media Academy since its inception in 2002."
