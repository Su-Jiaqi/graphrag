With it the band distanced themselves from their previous punk rock sound by incorporating much more of an influence of classic rock and heavy metal bands such as AC/DC, Mot\u00f6rhead and Def Leppard. They also distanced themselves from the secret agent mythos they had created for themselves by ceasing to wear matching black suits in concert and by ceasing to write songs dealing with the existence of extraterrestrials and UFOs. The song \"Loaded\" was originally titled \"Fuckin' Loaded\" but was changed for printing on the album sleeve. They received airplay on local rock radio station 91X for the song \"She's My Heroine.\" The album was the band's last before their extended hiatus, and they would not reconvene until a reunion show in 2005.
