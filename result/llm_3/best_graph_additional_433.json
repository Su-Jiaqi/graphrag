This genus was considered to have 250 species until Peter Taylor reduced the number to 214 in his exhaustive study, \"The genus Utricularia - a taxonomic monograph\", published by HMSO (1989). Taylor's classification is generally accepted, though his division of the genus in two subgenera was soon seen as obsolete. Molecular genetic studies have mostly confirmed Taylor's sections with some modifications (Jobson et al., 2003), but reinstalled the division of the genus in three subgenera. This list follows the subgeneric classification \"sensu\" M\u00fcller & Borsch (2005), updated with new information in M\u00fcller et al. (2006)."

There are said to be 10,000 black bears on Japan. The population of black bears on Shikoku and Kyushu may be endangered or extinct. There is a high price on bear parts in the black market, which threatens all bear populations in Japan. This particular species of bear are typically smaller with males only reaching 60-120 Kg and females only weighing about 40-100 Kg. Their body length is about 120\u2013140\u00a0cm long.",

It is the official provincial mammal of British Columbia. It is noted for about one-tenth of its population having white or cream-coloured coats like polar bears. This colour is due to a double recessive gene unique in the subspecies. They are not albinos and not any more related to polar bears or the \"blonde\" brown bears of Alaska's \"ABC Islands\" than other members of their species. Sometimes, a mother black bear can have a white cub.",

They also have been seen in Pennsylvania and New York. The most striking difference between a cinnamon bear and any other black bear is its brown or red-brown fur, reminiscent of cinnamon. The subspecies was given the designation because the lighter color phase is more common there than in other areas.",

The most significant morphological differences are its large size, massive cranium, and large molars. This subspecies is endemic to the Haida Gwaii (Queen Charlotte Islands) and is considered a \"keystone species\" because of the bears transportation of salmon remains into surrounding forests of Haida Gwaii."
