            "Silvio Dante\nSilvio Manfred Dante, played by Steven Van Zandt, is a fictional character on the HBO TV series \"The Sopranos\". He is the consigliere to Tony Soprano in the Soprano crime family. He is usually a behind-the-scenes figure and tries not to draw much attention to himself. He does very well at maintaining the image of a legitimate businessman as the manager and owner of the Bada Bing strip club. Silvio usually keeps his cool in even the worst situations but has been known to reveal his temper when necessary (or when playing poker). Silvio is a movie and film connoisseur and has an encyclopedic mind for movie lines. Throughout the series, he entertains the other family members by request with lukewarm Godfather impressions, mimicking Michael Corleone's remark in \"The Godfather Part III\": \"Just when I thought I was out...they pulled me back in.\" Silvio is one of the most loyal mobsters in the Soprano crime family.",

            "Headache (game)\nHeadache is a board game similar to the traditional game \"Mensch \u00e4rgere dich nicht\", in which the object is to land a playing piece on top of all opponents' pieces (known as \"cones\"). The game is distinct from \"Mensch \u00e4rgere dich nicht\" in that there is no finish the player must reach. Play moves in circles, until only one player has cones remaining on the board, being declared the winner. All players are welcome to occupy any space throughout the game, provided the die rolls allow, and there are eight spaces that serve as \"safe\" spots, where a cone resting on this space cannot be captured. Captured pieces are not sent back to start, but are permanently lost."
