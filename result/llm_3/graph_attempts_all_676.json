The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \"Homo\" and within this genus to the species \"Homo sapiens\". The \"formal\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \"Species Plantarum\" in 1753.

            "Asia Poker\nAsia Poker is a casino table game similar to Pai gow poker that is now popular in most Atlantic City, New Jersey casinos. Players are dealt seven cards and divide their cards into three hands: a four-card hand (High), a two-card hand (Medium) and a one-card hand (Low). The four-card hand must be equal or greater in poker ranking than the two-card hand and the two-card hand must be equal or greater than the one-card hand. After all players have set their hand, the dealer sets the house's hand according to the \"house way\" and then compares each player's hand to the house's hand. If the house wins at least two out of three hands, the player loses. If the player wins at least two or out of three hands the player wins. Unlike Pai gow poker, the casino does not charge a 5% vigorish for winning wagers. Rather, the house edge comes from winning all \"copy hands\" (a player's hand that is identical to the house's hand). Also, unlike Pai gow poker there are no ties in this game; the player either wins or loses. The House edge figures to be around 3% based on the probability of the player having a losing copy hand.",

The \"wild card\" is announced before the hand is dealt and can be substituted for any card in the deck according to what is most beneficial to the player's hand. Since the game uses a standard deck, there are always four \"wild cards\" in play. This allows the player greater flexibility in building a winning hand.",

The Brody family is featured in all of the films as the primary antithesis to the shark. The original film was based on a novel written by Peter Benchley, which itself was inspired by the Jersey Shore shark attacks of 1916. Benchley adapted his novel, along with help from Carl Gottlieb and Howard Sackler, into the 1975 film \"Jaws\", which was directed by Steven Spielberg. Although Gottlieb went on to pen two of the three sequels, neither Benchley nor Spielberg returned to the film series in any capacity."

            "Binomial nomenclature\nBinomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \"binomial\"), a binomen, binominal name or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \"Homo\" and within this genus to the species \"Homo sapiens\". The \"formal\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \"Species Plantarum\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \"Pinax theatri botanici\" (English, \"Illustrated exposition of plants\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.",
