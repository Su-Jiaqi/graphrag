In response to the problem of inadequate healthcare facilities for the elderly, a group of 8 churches and Christian organisations including the Graduate Christian Fellowship and the Singapore Nurses' Christian Fellowship came together to set up St Luke's Hospital for the Elderly Sick.

These samples are then processed (the organisms are isolated) and then analyzed and catalogued. The information (regarding the kind and number of organisms analyzed) is sent to the global headquarters of NaGISA- the University of Kyoto in Japan.

It was renamed as St Luke's hospital in September 2004 to signify the hospital's role as a community hospital while retaining its focus on geriatric care. The idea of setting up community hospital was first mooted by a group of Christian doctors and nurses after a report from the Advisory Council on the Aged in 1988 raised important issues concerning the lack of adequate elderly care facilities in Singapore. A projection of the number of facilities and resources needed to provide adequate healthcare services to Singapore's ageing population in 2030 revealed serious shortfalls. In response to the problem of inadequate healthcare facilities for the elderly, a group of 8 churches and Christian organisations including the Graduate Christian Fellowship and the Singapore Nurses' Christian Fellowship came together to set up St Luke's Hospital for the Elderly Sick.

            "Louis XVI style\nLouis XVI style, frequently also called Louis Seize, is a characteristic French style in art, architecture, and decorative motif which developed during the 19-year reign of the French monarch Louis XVI (1774\u20131793) though it often thought to encompass nearly twice that many (1750-1800). It saw the final phase of Rococo-style art as well as the birth of French neoclassicism and the Directoire style which followed it: whereas Rococo has become labeled as overdone and gawdy with its constant use of symmetric flourishes and excessive precise decoration, neoclassicism sought to evoke the artistic styles that were just then being rediscovered in Herculaneum and Pompeii: the straight column, the simplicity of the post-and-lintel, the architrave of the Greek temple, etc., as well as the Rousseau-inspired values of returning to nature and the view of nature as an idealized and wild but still orderly and inherently worthy model for the arts to follow.",
