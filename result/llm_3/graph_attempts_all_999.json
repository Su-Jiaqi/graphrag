            "I Love to Laugh\n\"I Love to Laugh\", also called \"We Love to Laugh\", is a song from Walt Disney's film \"Mary Poppins\". It was composed by Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman. The song is sung in the film by \"Uncle Albert\" (Ed Wynn), and \"Bert\" (Dick Van Dyke) as they levitate uncontrollably toward the ceiling, eventually joined by Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews) herself. The premise of the scene, that laughter and happiness cause Uncle Albert (and like-minded visitors) to float into the air, can be seen as a metaphor for the way laughter can \"lighten\" a mood. (Compare Peter Pan's flight power, which is also powered by happy thoughts.) Conversely, thinking of something sad literally brings Albert and his visitors \"down to earth\" again. The song states a case strongly in favor of laughter, even if Mary Poppins appears to disapprove of Uncle Albert's behavior, especially since it not only complicates the task of getting Albert down, but the infectious mood sends Bert and the Banks children into the air as well.",

Given the right conditions, timbers may survive over long periods of time and a recovered postpipe can simply be of solid wood. Under less preservative conditions however, only a dark circular stain of organic material may be left in the fill of the posthole observable in plan and section. This differs in consistency from the less organic backfill of the posthole and can be identified simply through this change in make-up. The size and depth and of the postpipe can provide information as to any reuse of the posthole especially if several different postpipes can be identified. They can also indicate the species of wood used and help suggest the nature of the structure that the timber once supported. The term was first used by Maud Cunnington when she excavated the site of Woodhenge in the English county of Wiltshire during the 1920s and found numerous examples of decomposed timber posts.",

The game is a variation of Deuces Wild and is based on five card draw where the player is dealt a five card hand. The player can then choose which cards to keep or discard and is dealt new cards accordingly. The payoff is based on the value of the hand. The \"wild card\" is announced before the hand is dealt and can be substituted for any card in the deck according to what is most beneficial to the player's hand.

            "I Love to Laugh\n\"I Love to Laugh\", also called \"We Love to Laugh\", is a song from Walt Disney's film \"Mary Poppins\". It was composed by Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman. The song is sung in the film by \"Uncle Albert\" (Ed Wynn), and \"Bert\" (Dick Van Dyke) as they levitate uncontrollably toward the ceiling, eventually joined by Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews) herself. The premise of the scene, that laughter and happiness cause Uncle Albert (and like-minded visitors) to float into the air, can be seen as a metaphor for the way laughter can \"lighten\" a mood. (Compare Peter Pan's flight power, which is also powered by happy thoughts.) Conversely, thinking of something sad literally brings Albert and his visitors \"down to earth\" again. The song states a case strongly in favor of laughter, even if Mary Poppins appears to disapprove of Uncle Albert's behavior, especially since it not only complicates the task of getting Albert down, but the infectious mood sends Bert and the Banks children into the air as well.",
