This treaty saw Mohammad Yaqub Khan cede various frontier areas to Britain while retaining full sovereignty over Afghanistan. The British and Indian soldiers then withdrew from Afghanistan, and the Afghan tribes were permitted to maintain internal rule and local customs, but had to cede control of the area's foreign relations to the British.\n\nThe Emirate of Afghanistan, ruled by Sher Ali Khan of the Barakzai dynasty, was the primary opposing force in the conflict. The Emirate emerged from the Durrani Empire and was characterized by the expansion of European colonial interests in South Asia, particularly the rivalry between the Russian Empire and the United Kingdom for supremacy in Central Asia.\n\nThe war also had significant cultural and historical impacts, as seen in the construction of the Maiwand Lion, a war memorial in Reading, England, commemorating the deaths of 329 men from the 66th (Berkshire) Regiment of Foot during the campaign in the Second Anglo-Afghan War.\n\nOverall, the Second Anglo-Afghan War was a complex conflict with multiple phases and significant geopolitical implications for both Afghanistan and the British Raj.",

At the beginning of the conflict, British forces had defeated the forces of Afghan Emir Dost Mohammad Barakzai and in 1839 occupied Kabul, restoring the former ruler, Shah Shujah Durrani, as emir. However a deteriorating situation made their position more and more precarious, until an uprising in Kabul forced the then commander, Major General Sir William Elphinstone, to withdraw the garrison. To this end he negotiated an agreement with Wazir Akbar Khan, one of the sons of Dost Mohammad Barakzai, by which his army was to fall back to the British garrison at Jalalabad, more than 90 mi away. As the army and its numerous dependents and camp-followers began its march, it came under attack from Afghan tribesmen.

The second phase (the main, and most devastating phase) was caused by a very strong La Ni\u00f1a event, which lasted from June 2010 to June 2011. According to meteorologists, the 2010\u201311 La Ni\u00f1a event was one of the strongest La Ni\u00f1a events ever observed. That same La Ni\u00f1a event also had devastating effects in the Eastern states of Australia. The second phase lasted from June 2010 to October 2010, caused severe heat waves, and multiple record-breaking temperatures. The heatwaves began on April 2010, when strong anticyclones began to develop, over most of the affected regions, in the Northern Hemisphere. The heatwaves ended in October 2010, when the powerful anticyclones over most of the affected areas dissipated.",

The Taliban's Emirate received recognition only from Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates. The defense minister of the Islamic State of Afghanistan, Ahmad Shah Massoud, created the United Front (Northern Alliance) in opposition to the Taliban. The United Front included all Afghan ethnicities: Tajiks, Uzbeks, Hazaras, Turkmens, some Pashtuns and others. During the conflict, the Taliban received military support from Pakistan and financial support from Saudi Arabia. Pakistan militarily intervened in Afghanistan, deploying battalions and regiments of its Frontier Corps and Army against the United Front.

This period was characterized by the expansion of European colonial interests in South Asia. The Emirate of Afghanistan continued the war with the Sikh Empire, which led to the invasion of Afghanistan by British-led Indian forces who completely wiped out the Afghans in 1842 but did not fulfil their initial war objectives.
