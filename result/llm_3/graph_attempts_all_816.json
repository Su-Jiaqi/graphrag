            "Mohammad Khan Ustajlu\nMohammad Khan Ustajlu (d. 1514) was an early 16th-century Safavid military commander of Turkoman origin who served during the reign of king Ismail I (1501-1524). He played a pivotal role in Ismail I's conquests and expansion in Asia Minor and Mesopotamia. When Ismail I returned to Khoy, after some skirmishes with 'Ala' al-Dowleh, he appointed Mohammad Khan Ustajlu as the new governor (\"beglarbeg\") of Diyarbekir. Mohammad Khan Ustajlu was the son of Mirza Beg, the brother of Owlash Beg and the husband of one of king Ismail I's sisters. At the decisive Battle of Chaldiran (1514), Mohammad Khan Ustajlu was one of the two Safavid commanders, the other one being Nur-Ali Khalifa, who had first-hand experience with the Ottomans ways of warfare. Mohammad Khan, who counseled against a frontal attack, was rejected by both Durmish Khan Shamlu as well as by the king himself. Durmish Khan then attempted to put Mohammad Khan on his place, by the means of rude commentary. Subsequently, Durmish Khan made a completely different proposal for the Safavid attack compared to what both Mohammad Khan and Nur-Ali Khalifa had mentioned, which Ismail I surprisingly endorsed. Due to Durmish Khan's tactic, the center of the Ottoman army at Chaldiran remained intact, which included the janissaries and most of the artillery, and which was to be used with devastating effect. Mohammad Khan, who was in command of the left wing of the Safavid army, was killed, and his men fell in disarray.",

            "Family entertainment center\nA family entertainment center (or centre), often abbreviated FEC in the entertainment industry, (also known as indoor amusement park or indoor theme park) is a small amusement park marketed towards families with small children to teenagers, and often entirely indoors or associated with a larger operation such as a theme park. They usually cater to \"sub-regional markets of larger metropolitan areas.\" FECs are generally small compared to full-scale amusement parks, with fewer attractions, a lower per-person per-hour cost to consumers than a traditional amusement park, and not usually major tourist attractions, but sustained by an area customer base. Many are locally owned and operated, although there are a number of chains and franchises in the field. FECs are sometimes called family amusement centers, play zones, family fun centers, or simply fun centers. Some non-traditional FECs, called urban entertainment centers (UECs), with more customized and branded attractions and retail outlets, are associated with major entertainment companies and may be tourist destinations. Others, sometimes operated by Non-Profit organizations as Children's Museums or Science Centers, tend to be geared toward edutainment experiences rather than simply amusement.

At the decisive Battle of Chaldiran (1514), Mohammad Khan Ustajlu was one of the two Safavid commanders, the other one being Nur-Ali Khalifa, who had first-hand experience with the Ottomans ways of warfare. Mohammad Khan, who counseled against a frontal attack, was rejected by both Durmish Khan Shamlu as well as by the king himself. Durmish Khan then attempted to put Mohammad Khan on his place, by the means of rude commentary. Subsequently, Durmish Khan made a completely different proposal for the Safavid attack compared to what both Mohammad Khan and Nur-Ali Khalifa had mentioned, which Ismail I surprisingly endorsed. Due to Durmish Khan's tactic, the center of the Ottoman army at Chaldiran remained intact, which included the janissaries and most of the artillery, and which was to be used with devastating effect. Mohammad Khan, who was in command of the left wing of the Safavid army, was killed, and his men fell in disarray.",

The song is sung in the film by \"Uncle Albert\" (Ed Wynn), and \"Bert\" (Dick Van Dyke) as they levitate uncontrollably toward the ceiling, eventually joined by Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews) herself. The premise of the scene, that laughter and happiness cause Uncle Albert (and like-minded visitors) to float into the air, can be seen as a metaphor for the way laughter can \"lighten\" a mood. (Compare Peter Pan's flight power, which is also powered by happy thoughts.) Conversely, thinking of something sad literally brings Albert and his visitors \"down to earth\" again. The song states a case strongly in favor of laughter, even if Mary Poppins appears to disapprove of Uncle Albert's behavior, especially since it not only complicates the task of getting Albert down, but the infectious mood sends Bert and the Banks children into the air as well.",

Given the right conditions, timbers may survive over long periods of time and a recovered postpipe can simply be of solid wood. Under less preservative conditions however, only a dark circular stain of organic material may be left in the fill of the posthole observable in plan and section. This differs in consistency from the less organic backfill of the posthole and can be identified simply through this change in make-up. The size and depth and of the postpipe can provide information as to any reuse of the posthole especially if several different postpipes can be identified. They can also indicate the species of wood used and help suggest the nature of the structure that the timber once supported. The term was first used by Maud Cunnington when she excavated the site of Woodhenge in the English county of Wiltshire during the 1920s and found numerous examples of decomposed timber posts.",

            "Memory of Mankind\nSeveral motivations underlie the project. The primary ambition of MOM is to preserve an image of our era, created by numerous participants all over the planet. MOM will also contain information which our society is obliged to forward to the future: e.g. description of nuclear waste repositories. MOM collaborates with the NEA and SKB. Although the most obvious ambition and often described in the media is the concern about preserving our knowledge, this is not the primary goal of MOM. Serving as a time capsule MOM is both: in a time frame of millennia it is the story about us, and in a time frame of decades it is a backup. In times where global warming, nuclear danger and biological warfare threaten the existence of civilization, saving the core knowledge and culture acquired over centuries is a backup measure. In case of a collapse, the MOM project could help survivors to rebuild civilization. Linked to this, an another reason is of political order: facing the lack of reactivity of authorities concerning global warming, the MOM project is a reminder of what can happen. Roman and Greek civilizations whose histories have been reconstructed by the small percentage of texts and artifacts which survived until our days are examples that have inspired the MOM project. Finally, it's a critic of our digital civilization : according to Kunze, maybe nothing of the 21st century will last in the future, since most of our interactions are now virtual. The \"accuracy versus bullshit\" is one of the main themes of the MOM project, worried about loss of information, the project can only aim to save a fragment of the information produced until today, but this fragment has to be representative.",

            "Sharon Gannon\nSharon Gannon (born July 4, 1951 in Washington, D.C.) is a yoga teacher, animal rights advocate, musician, author, dancer/choreographer and painter. Along with David Life, she is the co-founder of the Jivamukti Yoga Method which contributed to the exponential rise in popularity of yoga in the west during the late 20th century. The Jivamukti Yoga Method distinguishes itself as a path to enlightenment by promoting compassion for all beings, challenging the modern belief that enslaving and exploiting animals and the natural world is our right as the dominant species. The Jivamukti Yoga Method teaches its students that they must be willing to promote the happiness of all beings without exception if they wish to realize their fullest capacity for joy. Jivamukti students are encouraged to adopt a diet that eliminates all animal products (vegan) as this is the diet that causes the least amount of harm to the earth and other beings, humans included. Core to the teachings of Jivamukti Yoga is the concept of shunyata or (emptiness) which is found in the ancient yogic scriptures. This idea can be simply stated as: everything you see and experience in the world comes from your perception of it. If you want to change someone or to change the world, you start by changing yourself by changing your views. When you begin to embrace this concept and put it into practice then you cannot find solace in complaining or blaming others. You are freed from seeing yourself as a victim of others or of circumstances. According to Gannon: \"How you treat others will determine how others treat you. How others treat you will determine how you see yourself. How you see yourself will determine who you are.\"",
