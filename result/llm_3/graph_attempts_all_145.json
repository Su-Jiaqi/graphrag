Although they finished with only a respectable 10\u20136 record, good for a second-place finish in the NFC North, the Packers never lost a game by more than four points, and never trailed by more than seven the entire season, becoming the only team since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970 to accomplish this. All six of their regular season losses were by a combined 20 points. They entered the playoffs as the NFC's sixth seed. After defeating the Philadelphia Eagles 21\u201316 in the Wild Card round, the Atlanta Falcons 48\u201321 in the Divisional round and the Chicago Bears 21\u201314 in the NFC Championship, the team advanced to Super Bowl XLV in which they faced the AFC's 2nd seed Pittsburgh Steelers. The Packers defeated the Steelers 31\u201325 to win their fourth Super Bowl and 13th NFL championship. The Packers became the second overall team after the 2005 Pittsburgh Steelers, and the first NFC team, to win the Super Bowl as a sixth seed, as well as becoming the second NFC team to win three straight road playoff games (the 2007 New York Giants won three straight road games as a five seed).",

            "Dion Lewis\nDion John Lewis (born September 27, 1990) is an American football running back for the New England Patriots of the National Football League (NFL). He was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in the fifth round of the 2011 NFL Draft. With the Patriots, he won Super Bowl LI over the Atlanta Falcons. He played college football at the University of Pittsburgh. Lewis has also played for the Cleveland Browns and Indianapolis Colts. His Patriots teammate, receiver Julian Edelman, has nicknamed Lewis both \"Jitterbug\" and \"Little Dirty\". Lewis had not played for two seasons before signing with the Patriots in 2015, and was a significant contributor to the New England offense before a season-ending knee injury in Week 9 put him out of the line-up. Two reconstructive surgeries on his damaged knee kept him sidelined until part way through the 2016 season, his return on November 12, 2016 made a direct impact; his career-defining performance coming in the Patriots over the Houston Texans, where Lewis had 188 all-purpose yards and became the first player in NFL history to score a touchdown on a rush, a reception, and a kick return during the same playoff game. Notably, as of the end of the 2016-2017 season, Lewis has never played in a game which the Patriots have subsequently lost.",
