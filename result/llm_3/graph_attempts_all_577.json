            "Delhi Sultanate\nThe Delhi Sultanate was a Muslim sultanate based mostly in Delhi that stretched over large parts of the Indian subcontinent for 320 years (1206\u20131526). Five dynasties ruled over the Delhi Sultanate sequentially: the Mamluk dynasty (1206\u201390), the Khalji dynasty (1290\u20131320), the Tughlaq dynasty (1320\u20131414), the Sayyid dynasty (1414\u201351), and the Lodi dynasty (1451\u20131526). Three dynasties (Mamluk, Khalji and Sayyid) were of Turkic origin, one dynasty (Tughlaq) was of Turko-Indian origin, and the last dynasty (Lodi) was of Pashtun origin. The sultanate is noted for being one of the few states to repel an attack by the Mongol Empire, and enthroned one of the few female rulers in Islamic history, Razia Sultana, who reigned from 1236 to 1240.",

            "Founding of modern Singapore\nA significant port and settlement, known as Temasek, later renamed Singapura, existed on the island of Singapore in the 14th century. Vietnamese records indicate possible diplomatic relationship between Temasek and Vietnam in the 13th century, and Chinese documents describe settlements there in the 14th century. It was likely a vassal state of both the Majapahit Empire and the Siamese at different times in the 14th century. Around the end of the 14th century, its ruler Parameswara was attacked by either the Majapahit or the Siamese, forcing him to move on to Melaka where he founded the Sultanate of Malacca, Archaeological evidence suggests that the main settlement on Fort Canning was abandoned around this time, although a small-scale trading settlement continued in Singapore for some time afterwards. Between the 16th and 19th centuries, the Malay archipelago was gradually taken over by the European colonial powers, beginning with the Portuguese conquest of Malacca Sultanate in 1511. In 1613, the Portuguese burnt down a trading settlement at the mouth of the Singapore River, after which Singapore lapsed into insignificance in the history of the region for two hundred years.",

Hoysala influence was at its peak in the 13th century, when it dominated the Southern Deccan Plateau region. Large and small temples built during this era remain as examples of the Hoysala architectural style, including the Chennakesava Temple at Belur, the Hoysaleswara Temple at Halebidu, and the Kesava Temple at Somanathapura. Other examples of Hoysala craftsmanship are the temples at Belavadi, Amruthapura, Hosaholalu, Mosale, Arasikere, Basaralu, Kikkeri and Nuggehalli. Study of the Hoysala architectural style has revealed a negligible Indo-Aryan influence while the impact of Southern Indian style is more distinct.",
            "Intabulation\nIntabulation, from the Italian word \"intavolatura\", refers to an arrangement of a vocal or ensemble piece for keyboard, lute, or other plucked string instrument, written in tablature. It was a common practice in 14th\u201316th century keyboard and lute music. A direct effect of intabulation was one of the early advantages of keyboards, the ability to render multiple instruments' music on one instrument. The earliest intabulation is from the mid-14th century Robertsbridge Codex, also one of the first sources of keyboard music still in existence. Some other early sources of intabulated music are the Faenza and Reina manuscripts (from the 14th century) and the Buxheim manuscript (from the 15th century). The Faenza manuscript,the largest of these early manuscripts, written circa 1400, contains pieces written or transcribed in the 14th century, such as those by Francesco Landini and Guillaume de Machaut. More than half of its pieces are intabulations. The large Buxheim manuscript is dominated by intabulations, mainly of prominent composers of the time, including John Dunstaple, Gilles Binchois, Walter Frye, and Guillaume Dufay. The term \"intabulation\" continued to be popular through the 16th century, but fell out of use in the early 17th century, though the practice continued. The exception is the 16th- and 17th-century Italian keyboard pieces which included both vocal and instrumental music. Intabulations contain all the vocal lines of a polyphonic piece, for the most part, although they are sometimes combined or redistributed in order to work better on the instrument the intabulation is intended for, and idiomatic ornaments are sometimes added.",
            "List of classical music festivals\nThe following is an incomplete list of classical music festivals, which encapsulates music festivals focused on classical music. Classical music is art music produced or rooted in the traditions of Western music (both liturgical and secular), and has long been played at festival-like settings. It encompasses a broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day. The major time divisions of classical music are as follows: the early music period, which includes the Medieval (500\u20131400) and the Renaissance (1400\u20131600) era, played at early music festivals; the common practice period, which includes the Baroque (1600\u20131750), Classical (1750\u20131830), and Romantic eras (1804\u20131910), which included opera festivals and choral festivals; and the 20th century (1901\u20132000) which includes the modern (1890\u20131930) that overlaps from the late 19th-century, the high modern (mid 20th-century), and contemporary classical music festivals or postmodern (1975\u20132000) eras, the last of which overlaps into the 21st-century. The term \"classical music\" did not appear until the early 19th century, in an attempt to distinctly canonize the period from Johann Sebastian Bach to Beethoven as a golden age.",

            "Intabulation\nIntabulation, from the Italian word \"intavolatura\", refers to an arrangement of a vocal or ensemble piece for keyboard, lute, or other plucked string instrument, written in tablature. It was a common practice in 14th\u201316th century keyboard and lute music. A direct effect of intabulation was one of the early advantages of keyboards, the ability to render multiple instruments' music on one instrument. The earliest intabulation is from the mid-14th century Robertsbridge Codex, also one of the first sources of keyboard music still in existence. Some other early sources of intabulated music are the Faenza and Reina manuscripts (from the 14th century) and the Buxheim manuscript (from the 15th century). The Faenza manuscript,the largest of these early manuscripts, written circa 1400, contains pieces written or transcribed in the 14th century, such as those by Francesco Landini and Guillaume de Machaut. More than half of its pieces are intabulations. The large Buxheim manuscript is dominated by intabulations, mainly of prominent composers of the time, including John Dunstaple, Gilles Binchois, Walter Frye, and Guillaume Dufay. The term \"intabulation\" continued to be popular through the 16th century, but fell out of use in the early 17th century, though the practice continued. The exception is the 16th- and 17th-century Italian keyboard pieces which included both vocal and instrumental music. Intabulations contain all the vocal lines of a polyphonic piece, for the most part, although they are sometimes combined or redistributed in order to work better on the instrument the intabulation is intended for, and idiomatic ornaments are sometimes added.",

            "Intabulation\nIntabulation, from the Italian word \"intavolatura\", refers to an arrangement of a vocal or ensemble piece for keyboard, lute, or other plucked string instrument, written in tablature. It was a common practice in 14th\u201316th century keyboard and lute music. A direct effect of intabulation was one of the early advantages of keyboards, the ability to render multiple instruments' music on one instrument. The earliest intabulation is from the mid-14th century Robertsbridge Codex, also one of the first sources of keyboard music still in existence. Some other early sources of intabulated music are the Faenza and Reina manuscripts (from the 14th century) and the Buxheim manuscript (from the 15th century). The Faenza manuscript,the largest of these early manuscripts, written circa 1400, contains pieces written or transcribed in the 14th century, such as those by Francesco Landini and Guillaume de Machaut. More than half of its pieces are intabulations. The large Buxheim manuscript is dominated by intabulations, mainly of prominent composers of the time, including John Dunstaple, Gilles Binchois, Walter Frye, and Guillaume Dufay. The term \"intabulation\" continued to be popular through the 16th century, but fell out of use in the early 17th century, though the practice continued. The exception is the 16th- and 17th-century Italian keyboard pieces which included both vocal and instrumental music. Intabulations contain all the vocal lines of a polyphonic piece, for the most part, although they are sometimes combined or redistributed in order to work better on the instrument the intabulation is intended for, and idiomatic ornaments are sometimes added.",

It was likely a vassal state of the Majapahit Empire and the Siamese at different times. The ruler Parameswara was forced to move to Melaka where he founded the Sultanate of Malacca. Singapore lapsed into insignificance in the history of the region for two hundred years.\n\nDelhi Sultanate: The Delhi Sultanate was a Muslim sultanate based in Delhi that stretched over large parts of the Indian subcontinent for 320 years (1206\u20131526). It was ruled by five dynasties sequentially and is noted for repelling an attack by the Mongol Empire and having one of the few female rulers in Islamic history, Razia Sultana.\n\nRoyal house of Sulu: The Royal House of Sulu is an Islamic royal house that ruled the Sulu Sultanate, now part of Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. The current ruling lineage is the Royal House of Kiram, descending from Sultan Jamalul Kiram I.\n\nIntabulation: Intabulation refers to an arrangement of a vocal or ensemble piece for keyboard, lute, or other plucked string instrument, written in tablature. It was a common practice in 14th\u201316th century keyboard and lute music, allowing the rendering of multiple instruments' music on one instrument.\n\nEarly Anatolian Animal carpets: Anatolian animal carpets were a special type of pile-woven carpet woven in the geographical region of Anatolia during the Seljuq and early Ottoman period, corresponding to the 14th\u201316th century.\n\nArchitecture Studies Library: The Architecture Studies Library is located on the University of Nevada, Las Vegas campus, providing historical and current information and resources about architecture in Las Vegas.\n\nCreation Research Society: The Creation Research Society is a Christian research group that engages in creation science, producing various publications and experiencing disagreements over its statement of beliefs in its early years.",
            "Based on the retrieved historical data, the duration of existence for the identified states and empires is as follows:\n\nHalebidu: The Hoysala Empire, with Halebidu as its regal capital, existed in the 12th century and was ransacked and looted twice by north Indian Muslim armies of the Delhi Sultanate in the 14th century, leading to its abandonment. Therefore, the duration of existence for the Hoysala Empire can be estimated to be approximately 200 years.\n\nFounding of modern Singapore: The settlement known as Temasek, later renamed Singapura, existed in the 14th century and lapsed into insignificance for two hundred years. Therefore, the duration of existence for the settlement of Singapura can be estimated to be approximately 200 years.\n\nDelhi Sultanate: The Delhi Sultanate existed for 320 years (1206\u20131526) and was ruled by five dynasties sequentially. Therefore, the duration of existence for the Delhi Sultanate is 320 years.\n\nRoyal house of Sulu: The Royal House of Sulu ruled the Sulu Sultanate and is currently represented by the Royal House of Kiram. The exact duration of existence for the Royal House of Sulu is not specified in the retrieved historical data.\n\nIntabulation: Intabulation was a common practice in 14th\u201316th century keyboard and lute music. Therefore, the duration of existence for the practice of intabulation can be estimated to be approximately 200 years.\n\nEarly Anatolian Animal carpets: Anatolian animal carpets were woven during the Seljuq and early Ottoman period, corresponding to the 14th\u201316th century. Therefore, the duration of existence for the Anatolian animal carpets can be estimated to be approximately 200 years.\n\nBased on the retrieved historical data, the Architecture Studies Library and the Creation Research Society are not states or empires, so their duration of existence is not applicable in this context."
