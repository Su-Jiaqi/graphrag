            "Damnation\nDamnation (from Latin \"damnatis\") is the concept of divine punishment and torment in an afterlife for actions that were committed on Earth. In Ancient Egyptian religious tradition, citizens would recite the 42 negative confessions of Maat as their heart was weighed against the feather of truth. If the citizen's heart was heavier than a feather they would face torment in a lake of fire. Zoroastrianism developed an eschatological concept of a Last Judgment called Frashokereti where the dead will be raised and the righteous wade though a river of milk while the wicked will be burned in a river of molten metal. Abrahamic religions such as Christianity have similar concepts of believers facing judgement on a last day to determine if they will spend eternity in Gehenna or heaven for their sin . A damned human \"in damnation\" is said to be either in Hell, or living in a state wherein they are divorced from Heaven and/or in a state of disgrace from God's favor. In traditional Abrahamic demonology, the Devil rules Hell, where he and his demons punish the damned.",
            "Ancient Egyptian offering formula\nThe Ancient Egyptian offering formula, generally referred to as the \u1e25tp-d\u1ec9-nsw formula by Egyptologists, was written as an offering for the deceased in the ancient Egyptian religion. The offering formula was believed to allow the deceased to partake in offerings presented to the major deities in the name of the king, or in offerings presented directly to the deceased by family members. All ancient Egyptian offering formulas share the same basic structure, but there is a great deal of variety in which deities and offerings are mentioned, and which epithets and titles are used. Below is an example of a typical offering formula:",
            "Ancient Egyptian religion\nAncient Egyptian religion was a complex system of polytheistic beliefs and rituals which were an integral part of ancient Egyptian society. It centered on the Egyptians' interaction with many deities who were believed to be present in, and in control of, the forces of nature. Rituals such as prayers and offerings were efforts to provide for the gods and gain their favor. Formal religious practice centered on the pharaoh, the king of Egypt, who was believed to possess a divine power by virtue of his position. He acted as the intermediary between his people and the gods and was obligated to sustain the gods through rituals and offerings so that they could maintain order in the universe. The state dedicated enormous resources to Egyptian rituals and to the construction of the temples.",
            "Pyramid Texts\nThe Pyramid Texts are a collection of ancient Egyptian religious texts from the time of the Old Kingdom. Written in Old Egyptian, the pyramid texts were carved on the walls and sarcophagi of the pyramids at Saqqara during the 5th and 6th Dynasties of the Old Kingdom. The oldest of the texts have been dated to between ca. 2400\u20132300 BC. Unlike the later Coffin Texts and Book of the Dead, the pyramid texts were reserved only for the pharaoh and were not illustrated. Following the earlier Palermo Stone, the pyramid texts mark the next-oldest known mention of Osiris, who would become the most important deity associated with afterlife in the Ancient Egyptian religion.",
            "Ancient Egyptian deities\nAncient Egyptian deities are the gods and goddesses worshipped in ancient Egypt. The beliefs and rituals surrounding these gods formed the core of ancient Egyptian religion, which emerged sometime in prehistory. Deities represented natural forces and phenomena, and the Egyptians supported and appeased them through offerings and rituals so that these forces would continue to function according to \"maat\", or divine order. After the founding of the Egyptian state around 3100\u00a0BC, the authority to perform these tasks was controlled by the pharaoh, who claimed to be the gods' representative and managed the temples where the rituals were carried out.",
            "Traditional Berber religion\nThe traditional Berber religion is the ancient and native set of beliefs and deities adhered to by the Berber autochthones of North Africa. Many ancient Berber beliefs were developed locally whereas others were influenced over time through contact with other traditional African religions (such as the Ancient Egyptian religion), or borrowed during antiquity from the Punic religion, Judaism, Iberian mythology, and the Hellenistic religion. The most recent influence came from Islam and pre-Islamic Arab religion during the medieval period. Some of the ancient Berber beliefs still exist today subtly within the Berber popular culture and tradition.",

            "Osiris myth\nThe Osiris myth is the most elaborate and influential story in ancient Egyptian mythology. It concerns the murder of the god Osiris, a primeval king of Egypt, and its consequences. Osiris's murderer, his brother Set, usurps his throne. Meanwhile, Osiris's wife Isis restores her husband's body, allowing him to posthumously conceive a son with her. The remainder of the story focuses on Horus, the product of the union of Isis and Osiris, who is at first a vulnerable child protected by his mother and then becomes Set's rival for the throne. Their often violent conflict ends with Horus's triumph, which restores order to Egypt after Set's unrighteous reign and completes the process of Osiris's resurrection. The myth, with its complex symbolism, is integral to the Egyptian conceptions of kingship and succession, conflict between order and disorder, and especially death and the afterlife. It also expresses the essential character of each of the four deities at its center, and many elements of their worship in ancient Egyptian religion were derived from the myth.",

            "Guido Coen\nGuido Coen (1915\u20132010) was an Italian-born British film producer and film subtitler. He and his family were interned in Douglas on the Isle of Man during the Second World War. He began his career working for Filippo Del Giudice and Two Cities Films. When Two Cities was absorbed into the Rank Organisation in the mid-1940s Coen was employed by Sir David Cunynghame of London Film Productions as a subtitler. As Coen later described it in an interview, he did not know anything about subtitling at the time, and learned on the job: I finally got a phone call from London Films, Sir Cunnyngham, that 's it, who asked me whether I had ever subtitles pictures. I immediately said I had when in point of fact I did not know what he meant, and there was a young man in the office with Sir David Cunnynghame called Lew Watt, and he said Lew Watt will do the technical side and we want you to subtitle an Italian picture in to English. I said certainly . I came out of his office and Lew Watt said to me you don't know what they're talking about do you, I said you're quite right, he said well I'll show you. And I started subtitling pictures with Lew Watt, I used to do the literary side, and he used to do the technical side, the spotting, and lengths, and we together did subtitles for 40 or 50 pictures. The funny thing was we subtitled pictures in Chinese, in Indian and for the Chinese picture I had to have a Chinese waiter with me to tell me where the subtitles [...] I had the Italian dialogue and I had the picture, they gave me a film and we did the spotting together with Lew Watt and the measurements and I used to type the script. We had the film, we had the print which used to run on the two sided thing. And Lew Watt was working all the day so we had to do this at night, so we either used to work at night till 2 o'clock in the morning or we used to work at the weekends. There was always the problem that the Movieola might break down and so we had spare keys of other cutting rooms in in elm St in case we were caught. And that was how we started.Coen later founded his own company Kenilworth Film Productions and spent most of the post-war years producing second features. He made a dozen films in partnership with the director Charles Saunders. He later produced the 1971 horror film \"Burke & Hare\" and the comedies \"Au Pair Girls\" and \"Intimate Games.\"",

            "NaGISA\nNaGISA (Natural Geography in Shore Areas or Natural Geography of In-Shore Areas) is an international collaborative effort aimed at inventorying, cataloguing, and monitoring biodiversity of the in-shore area. So named for the Japanese word \"nagisa\" (\"where the land meets the sea\"), it is an Apronym. NaGISA is the first project of the larger CoML effort (Census of Marine Life) to have global participation in actual field work. The actual procedures of this project involve inexpensive collection equipment (for easy universal participation). This equipment is used to photograph sampling sites, to actually take samples from the sites, and to process these samples. At each site throughout the world, samples are taken from the intertidal zone out to a depth of 10 meters (and optionally out to 20 meters depth). These samples are then processed (the organisms are isolated) and then analyzed and catalogued. The information (regarding the kind and number of organisms analyzed) is sent to the global headquarters of NaGISA- the University of Kyoto in Japan. All of this information is then collated on the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS website). The end goal of the larger CoML effort is to find what \"was\", what \"is\", and what \"will be\" in the world's oceans. For NaGISA the goal is to find this in the world's in-shore areas.",

When the bodyboarder detaches completely from the wave surface or the lip the trick is called an \"air roll\" or \"aerial roll\". Other variations include the \"barrel roll\" where the roll is completed inside the barrel, and the \"rollo takeoff\" which is performed while catching the wave. This trick was named by someone in the industry. I remember the story where Pat Caldwell did the roll and Jack Lindholm or whoever saw him do it and commented \"what do you call that an el rollo\". Photos of the new move and captions started appearing in Bodyboarding Magazine. The move and the term caught on and spread around the world.",
            "Work college\nWork colleges are distinctive liberal arts colleges in the United States that promote the purposeful integration of work, learning, and service. At a work college all students work regardless of their academic program or their financial need. A work college is a public or private non-profit, four-year degree-granting institution of higher learning where student work is an integrated, essential and federally required core component of the educational work-learning-service program. Unlike Federal Work Study, which is solely need-based, work colleges do not differentiate between those that can afford to pay for their education from those that must work to cover their educational costs. At work colleges, students are regularly evaluated and assessed on their work performance and can be dismissed from the institution for non-performance in the work program. Students do not have the ability to \"buy\" their way out of the work requirement. Students perform essential institutional functions in every area imaginable on their campuses and gain a strong sense of ownership and responsibility for their campus community. Student labor enables work colleges to be far more operationally efficient and administratively lean (compared to more traditional colleges). This, in turn, contributes to lower operational costs which results in lower \u2013 and more affordable \u2013 tuition.",
            "See Yourself\n\"See Yourself\" is a song by English musician George Harrison, released on his 1976 album \"Thirty Three & 1/3\". Harrison began writing the song in 1967, while he was a member of the Beatles, in response to the public outcry surrounding bandmate Paul McCartney's admission that he had taken the hallucinogenic drug LSD. McCartney's announcement created a reaction in the press similar to that caused in 1966 by John Lennon's statement that the Beatles were more popular than Christianity. In its finished form, the song's lyrics advocate self-awareness and consideration for the consequences of one's actions. Musically, the composition contains unusual shifts in time signature from standard 4/4 to 9/8, while the songwords reflect the era of its genesis by recalling themes first espoused in the Beatles tracks \"Within You Without You\" and \"All You Need Is Love\"."

            "The process of weighing a person's soul in Ancient Egyptian religion is known as the \"Weighing of the Heart\" or \"The Judgment of Osiris\". In this process, the deceased's heart is weighed against the feather of Ma'at, the goddess of truth and justice. If the heart is lighter than the feather, it means the person lived a good and righteous life, and they are deemed worthy to enter the afterlife. However, if the heart is heavier than the feather, it signifies that the person has lived a sinful life and they will not be granted access to the afterlife.

The heart was seen as the seat of a person's emotions, thoughts, and intentions, and its purity was essential for a successful transition to the afterlife.\n\nOverall, the role of the heart in the judgment process in Ancient Egyptian religion was to serve as a measure of the individual's moral character and adherence to maat, ultimately determining their fate in the afterlife.",
            "In the ancient Egyptian religion, the goddess Ma'at played a crucial role in the judgment process of souls. Ma'at was the goddess of truth, justice, and cosmic order, and her role was to ensure that the souls of the deceased were judged fairly and in accordance with the principles of Ma'at. During the judgment process, the heart of the deceased was weighed against the feather of Ma'at, symbolizing truth and justice. If the heart was found to be lighter than the feather, it meant that the individual had lived a righteous life and would be granted entry into the afterlife. However, if the heart was heavier than the feather, it indicated that the individual had lived a life of wrongdoing and would face punishment in the afterlife.\n\nMa'at's role in the judgment process reflects the importance of upholding truth, justice, and moral integrity in ancient Egyptian society. The concept of Ma'at was central to the Egyptian belief system, and it was believed that maintaining harmony and balance in the world was essential for the well-being of both the living and the deceased. Therefore, Ma'at's presence in the judgment process served as a reminder of the ethical principles that guided the ancient Egyptians and the consequences of deviating from those principles.",
            "The 'Weighing of the Heart' ceremony was a crucial part of the ancient Egyptian religious beliefs and rituals. It was believed that after death, the deceased's heart would be weighed against the feather of Ma'at, the goddess of truth and justice. The ceremony took place in the Hall of Ma'at, where the heart of the deceased was placed on one side of a scale and the feather of Ma'at on the other. The god Anubis, the god of mummification and the afterlife, oversaw the ceremony, while Thoth, the god of wisdom, recorded the results.\n\nThe criteria used to determine the worthiness of the deceased were based on the concept of \"maat\", which represented truth, balance, order, harmony, and justice. The heart of the deceased had to be free from the weight of sin and wrongdoing, as it was believed that a heavy heart would be devoured by the demon Ammit, preventing the deceased from entering the afterlife.\n\nThe Ancient Egyptian offering formula, known as the \u1e25tp-d\u1ec9-nsw formula, was also an important aspect of the process, as it was written as an offering for the deceased to partake in offerings presented to the major deities in the name of the king, or in offerings presented directly to the deceased by family members. This was believed to ensure the favor of the gods and a successful passage into the afterlife.\n\nOverall, the 'Weighing of the Heart' ceremony was a symbolic representation of the individual's moral and ethical conduct during their lifetime, and the criteria for worthiness were based on the principles of truth, justice, and righteousness.",
            "The consequences of being deemed unworthy in the judgment process, as seen in various ancient religious traditions, include facing torment in a lake of fire, being burned in a river of molten metal, or being divorced from Heaven and living in a state of disgrace from God's favor. In the concept of the Lake of Fire, individuals whose hearts were heavier than a feather in the judgment process would face torment in a lake of fire, as seen in Ancient Egyptian religious tradition. Similarly, in Zoroastrianism, the wicked would be burned in a river of molten metal as part of the Last Judgment. In Abrahamic religions such as Christianity, believers face judgment on a last day to determine if they will spend eternity in Gehenna or heaven for their sin. Those deemed unworthy would face damnation in Hell, divorced from Heaven and living in a state of disgrace from God's favor.\n\nThe Osiris myth in ancient Egyptian mythology also highlights the consequences of being deemed unworthy, as it concerns the murder of the god Osiris and its consequences. Osiris's murderer, his brother Set, usurps his throne, leading to conflict and disorder. The myth expresses the consequences of unrighteousness and the restoration of order through the triumph of Horus.\n\nIn the context of the Ancient Egyptian religion, the Pyramid Texts and the Ancient Egyptian offering formula were important in providing rituals and offerings to the gods to gain their favor and ensure a positive afterlife. The Pyramid Texts, reserved for the pharaoh, mention Osiris, the most important deity associated with the afterlife in Ancient Egyptian religion. The offering formula was believed to allow the deceased to partake in offerings presented to the major deities or directly to the deceased by family members.\n\nOverall, the consequences of being deemed unworthy in the judgment process in various ancient religious traditions include facing torment, being divorced from Heaven, living in a state of disgrace, and experiencing conflict and disorder. These consequences highlight the importance of righteousness and the need to gain favor with the gods in order to ensure a positive afterlife.",

These consequences highlight the importance of righteousness and the need to gain favor with the gods in order to ensure a positive afterlife. The rituals and offerings to the gods, such as the Ancient Egyptian offering formula, were believed to be crucial in gaining their favor and ensuring a positive afterlife.\n\nOverall, the judgment of worthiness and the consequences of being deemed unworthy in ancient religious traditions underscored the significance of moral conduct and the pursuit of righteousness in order to attain a favorable afterlife."

It centered on the Egyptians' interaction with many deities who were believed to be present in, and in control of, the forces of nature. Rituals such as prayers and offerings were efforts to provide for the gods and gain their favor. Formal religious practice centered on the pharaoh, the king of Egypt, who was believed to possess a divine power by virtue of his position.

The remainder of the story focuses on Horus, the product of the union of Isis and Osiris, who is at first a vulnerable child protected by his mother and then becomes Set's rival for the throne. Their often violent conflict ends with Horus's triumph, which restores order to Egypt after Set's unrighteous reign and completes the process of Osiris's resurrection.

            "Osiris myth\nThe Osiris myth is the most elaborate and influential story in ancient Egyptian mythology. It concerns the murder of the god Osiris, a primeval king of Egypt, and its consequences. Osiris's murderer, his brother Set, usurps his throne. Meanwhile, Osiris's wife Isis restores her husband's body, allowing him to posthumously conceive a son with her. The remainder of the story focuses on Horus, the product of the union of Isis and Osiris, who is at first a vulnerable child protected by his mother and then becomes Set's rival for the throne. Their often violent conflict ends with Horus's triumph, which restores order to Egypt after Set's unrighteous reign and completes the process of Osiris's resurrection. The myth, with its complex symbolism, is integral to the Egyptian conceptions of kingship and succession, conflict between order and disorder, and especially death and the afterlife. It also expresses the essential character of each of the four deities at its center, and many elements of their worship in ancient Egyptian religion were derived from the myth.",

            "The Ancient Egyptian concept of afterlife judgment is closely tied to the beliefs and rituals surrounding their deities. In the Pyramid Texts, it is mentioned that the pharaoh would recite the 42 negative confessions of Maat as their heart was weighed against the feather of truth. If the heart was heavier than the feather, the individual would face torment in a lake of fire. This concept of judgment in the afterlife was integral to the Ancient Egyptian religion, and it was believed that the deceased needed to partake in offerings presented to the major deities in order to gain their favor and ensure a positive outcome in the afterlife. Additionally, the Osiris myth, which is a central story in ancient Egyptian mythology, also plays a role in the concept of afterlife judgment, as it involves the resurrection of Osiris and the conflict between order and disorder, death, and the afterlife. These beliefs and rituals were an integral part of Ancient Egyptian society and were centered around the pharaoh, who was believed to possess divine power and acted as the intermediary between the people and the gods. These concepts and beliefs are reflected in the extensive collection of ancient Egyptian antiquities housed in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, which provides insight into the religious practices and beliefs of the ancient Egyptians.",
            "The weighing of the heart ceremony is a significant and symbolic ritual in Egyptian mythology. It is part of the ancient Egyptian belief in the afterlife and the judgment of the soul. According to mythology, after death, the soul of the deceased would undergo judgment in the Hall of Ma'at, where the heart of the deceased would be weighed against the feather of Ma'at, the goddess of truth and justice.\n\nThe symbolism of this ceremony is profound, as the heart was considered the center of intelligence and emotion in ancient Egyptian belief. The heart was believed to contain the essence of a person's character and deeds. If the heart was found to be lighter than the feather of Ma'at, it meant that the deceased had lived a virtuous life and would be granted entry into the afterlife. However, if the heart was heavy with sin and wrongdoing, it would be devoured by the demon Ammit, and the soul would be condemned to eternal punishment.\n\nThe weighing of the heart ceremony reflects the importance of moral and ethical conduct in ancient Egyptian society, as well as the belief in divine justice and the consequences of one's actions in the afterlife. It also emphasizes the concept of balance and harmony, as the judgment was based on the principle of Ma'at, which represented truth, order, and cosmic balance.\n\nOverall, the weighing of the heart ceremony holds great significance in Egyptian mythology, serving as a powerful symbol of moral accountability, divine judgment, and the eternal fate of the soul in the afterlife.",

This concept of divine punishment and torment in the afterlife for actions committed on Earth was a central aspect of the judgement process. The ceremony also involved offerings and rituals to appease the ancient Egyptian deities, as well as the belief in the resurrection and triumph of Osiris, which was integral to the Egyptian conceptions of kingship and succession.

This concept of damnation is similar to the eschatological beliefs in Zoroastrianism and the Last Judgment in Abrahamic religions, where the wicked are also condemned to punishment in a fiery or hellish place. In the context of Ancient Egyptian religion, the outcome of being judged unworthy in the weighing process would result in facing torment in a lake of fire as a form of divine punishment and torment in the afterlife."

Their often violent conflict ends with Horus's triumph, which restores order to Egypt after Set's unrighteous reign and completes the process of Osiris's resurrection.

I immediately said I had when in point of fact I did not know what he meant, and there was a young man in the office with Sir David Cunnynghame called Lew Watt, and he said Lew Watt will do the technical side and we want you to subtitle an Italian picture in to English. I said certainly . I came out of his office and Lew Watt said to me you don't know what they're talking about do you, I said you're quite right, he said well I'll show you. And I started subtitling pictures with Lew Watt, I used to do the literary side, and he used to do the technical side, the spotting, and lengths, and we together did subtitles for 40 or 50 pictures. The funny thing was we subtitled pictures in Chinese, in Indian and for the Chinese picture I had to have a Chinese waiter with me to tell me where the subtitles [...] I had the Italian dialogue and I had the picture, they gave me a film and we did the spotting together with Lew Watt and the measurements and I used to type the script.

            "Work college\nWork colleges are distinctive liberal arts colleges in the United States that promote the purposeful integration of work, learning, and service. At a work college all students work regardless of their academic program or their financial need. A work college is a public or private non-profit, four-year degree-granting institution of higher learning where student work is an integrated, essential and federally required core component of the educational work-learning-service program. Unlike Federal Work Study, which is solely need-based, work colleges do not differentiate between those that can afford to pay for their education from those that must work to cover their educational costs. At work colleges, students are regularly evaluated and assessed on their work performance and can be dismissed from the institution for non-performance in the work program. Students do not have the ability to \"buy\" their way out of the work requirement. Students perform essential institutional functions in every area imaginable on their campuses and gain a strong sense of ownership and responsibility for their campus community. Student labor enables work colleges to be far more operationally efficient and administratively lean (compared to more traditional colleges). This, in turn, contributes to lower operational costs which results in lower \u2013 and more affordable \u2013 tuition."

If the heart is found to be lighter than the feather, it means that the deceased lived a righteous life and they are allowed to enter the afterlife. However, if the heart is heavier than the feather, it indicates that the deceased lived a sinful life and they are devoured by the demon Ammit, preventing them from entering the afterlife. This process was a crucial part of the belief system in Ancient Egypt and was depicted in various funerary texts and artwork.",
            "The 'weighing of the heart' ceremony was a significant ritual in Ancient Egyptian belief as it was believed to determine the fate of the deceased in the afterlife. According to the Ancient Egyptian religion, after death, the deceased's heart was weighed against the feather of truth, which represented the concept of Maat, or divine order. This ceremony took place in the Hall of Ma'at, where the god Anubis, the jackal-headed deity, would oversee the weighing process.\n\nThe significance of this ceremony lies in the belief that if the deceased's heart was found to be lighter than the feather, it meant that they had lived a virtuous life in accordance with Maat, and they would be granted entry into the afterlife. However, if the heart was found to be heavier than the feather, it indicated that the individual had lived a sinful life and would face damnation in the afterlife.\n\nThis belief in the weighing of the heart ceremony reflects the central role of Maat in Ancient Egyptian religion, as well as the emphasis on moral and ethical conduct in life. It also underscores the importance of rituals and offerings in ensuring a favorable outcome in the afterlife, as the deceased's ability to partake in offerings and gain favor with the gods was believed to be crucial for their eternal well-being.\n\nOverall, the 'weighing of the heart' ceremony was a pivotal aspect of Ancient Egyptian belief, shaping the understanding of the afterlife and the moral responsibilities of the deceased.

            "In Ancient Egyptian belief, if a person's heart is found to be heavier than the feather of truth in the ceremony, it would result in damnation. The individual would face torment in a lake of fire, as their actions on Earth would be judged and deemed unworthy. This concept of divine punishment and torment in the afterlife was a central part of Ancient Egyptian religious tradition. The consequences of having a heavy heart were severe, and the individual would be condemned to a state of disgrace and separation from the gods' favor.\n\nThe belief in damnation and the weighing of the heart against the feather of truth was a fundamental aspect of Ancient Egyptian religion. The rituals and offerings made to the deities were aimed at gaining their favor and maintaining order in the universe. The consequences of failing to uphold maat, or divine order, were dire, and the individual would face eternal damnation.\n\nThe Osiris myth, which is integral to Egyptian conceptions of death and the afterlife, also emphasizes the importance of righteousness and the consequences of one's actions. The story of Osiris's murder and resurrection, as well as the conflict between Horus and Set, reflects the belief in divine judgment and the ultimate triumph of righteousness over unrighteousness.\n\nIn conclusion, in Ancient Egyptian belief, the consequences of having a heavier heart than the feather of truth in the ceremony were damnation and eternal torment in the afterlife. This belief was central to the complex system of polytheistic beliefs and rituals in Ancient Egyptian religion, and it reflected the importance of upholding maat and living a righteous life."

            "Damnation\nDamnation (from Latin \"damnatis\") is the concept of divine punishment and torment in an afterlife for actions that were committed on Earth. In Ancient Egyptian religious tradition, citizens would recite the 42 negative confessions of Maat as their heart was weighed against the feather of truth. If the citizen's heart was heavier than a feather they would face torment in a lake of fire. Zoroastrianism developed an eschatological concept of a Last Judgment called Frashokereti where the dead will be raised and the righteous wade though a river of milk while the wicked will be burned in a river of molten metal. Abrahamic religions such as Christianity have similar concepts of believers facing judgement on a last day to determine if they will spend eternity in Gehenna or heaven for their sin . A damned human \"in damnation\" is said to be either in Hell, or living in a state wherein they are divorced from Heaven and/or in a state of disgrace from God's favor. In traditional Abrahamic demonology, the Devil rules Hell, where he and his demons punish the damned.",

After the founding of the Egyptian state around 3100\u00a0BC, the authority to perform these tasks was controlled by the pharaoh, who claimed to be the gods' representative and managed the temples where the rituals were carried out.",

Rituals such as prayers and offerings were efforts to provide for the gods and gain their favor. Formal religious practice centered on the pharaoh, the king of Egypt, who was believed to possess a divine power by virtue of his position.

            "Osiris myth\nThe Osiris myth is the most elaborate and influential story in ancient Egyptian mythology. It concerns the murder of the god Osiris, a primeval king of Egypt, and its consequences. Osiris's murderer, his brother Set, usurps his throne. Meanwhile, Osiris's wife Isis restores her husband's body, allowing him to posthumously conceive a son with her. The remainder of the story focuses on Horus, the product of the union of Isis and Osiris, who is at first a vulnerable child protected by his mother and then becomes Set's rival for the throne. Their often violent conflict ends with Horus's triumph, which restores order to Egypt after Set's unrighteous reign and completes the process of Osiris's resurrection.

NaGISA is the first project of the larger CoML effort (Census of Marine Life) to have global participation in actual field work. The actual procedures of this project involve inexpensive collection equipment (for easy universal participation). This equipment is used to photograph sampling sites, to actually take samples from the sites, and to process these samples. At each site throughout the world, samples are taken from the intertidal zone out to a depth of 10 meters (and optionally out to 20 meters depth). These samples are then processed (the organisms are isolated) and then analyzed and catalogued. The information (regarding the kind and number of organisms analyzed) is sent to the global headquarters of NaGISA- the University of Kyoto in Japan. All of this information is then collated on the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS website). The end goal of the larger CoML effort is to find what \"was\", what \"is\", and what \"will be\" in the world's oceans. For NaGISA the goal is to find this in the world's in-shore areas.",

The graph further investigates the ceremony's participants, particularly the gods involved, and the criteria used during the ceremony to evaluate a person's worthiness. Lastly, it interprets the implications of this judgment concerning damnation, connecting it to the mythological concept of the 'lake of fire' as a place of torment for the unworthy.

This differs in consistency from the less organic backfill of the posthole and can be identified simply through this change in make-up. The size and depth and of the postpipe can provide information as to any reuse of the posthole especially if several different postpipes can be identified. They can also indicate the species of wood used and help suggest the nature of the structure that the timber once supported.

            "Sharon Gannon\nSharon Gannon (born July 4, 1951 in Washington, D.C.) is a yoga teacher, animal rights advocate, musician, author, dancer/choreographer and painter. Along with David Life, she is the co-founder of the Jivamukti Yoga Method which contributed to the exponential rise in popularity of yoga in the west during the late 20th century. The Jivamukti Yoga Method distinguishes itself as a path to enlightenment by promoting compassion for all beings, challenging the modern belief that enslaving and exploiting animals and the natural world is our right as the dominant species. The Jivamukti Yoga Method teaches its students that they must be willing to promote the happiness of all beings without exception if they wish to realize their fullest capacity for joy. Jivamukti students are encouraged to adopt a diet that eliminates all animal products (vegan) as this is the diet that causes the least amount of harm to the earth and other beings, humans included. Core to the teachings of Jivamukti Yoga is the concept of shunyata or (emptiness) which is found in the ancient yogic scriptures. This idea can be simply stated as: everything you see and experience in the world comes from your perception of it. If you want to change someone or to change the world, you start by changing yourself by changing your views. When you begin to embrace this concept and put it into practice then you cannot find solace in complaining or blaming others. You are freed from seeing yourself as a victim of others or of circumstances. According to Gannon: \"How you treat others will determine how others treat you. How others treat you will determine how you see yourself. How you see yourself will determine who you are.\"",

Instead, they would face damnation and the lake of fire, which was a place of punishment for the wicked in Ancient Egyptian belief. This punishment was a terrifying prospect for the ancient Egyptians, as it meant being separated from the gods and facing eternal suffering.
