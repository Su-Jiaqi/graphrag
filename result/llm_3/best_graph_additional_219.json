Licensed to Jefferson City, Missouri, United States, the station serves the Columbia, Missouri area. The station is currently owned by Cumulus Media and features programing from ABC Radio and Westwood One. KLIK also operates a local news operation with sister station KFRU (1400 AM in Columbia, Missouri). From 1954 until September 8, 1999, KLIK was located at 950 AM, transmitting with a daytime power of 5000 watts and a nighttime power of 500 watts (directional) from a four tower array about 3.2 miles south of Jefferson City. Early owners of KLIK broadcast a varied format of news and talk programs including music programs of middle of the road, top 40, adult contemporary and country music as 95 KLIK. For many years, KLIK and KJFF as the two largest regional radio stations (the most powerful AM and FM station in the region) dominated radio listenership in cumulative market share in the Columbia-Jeff City Market of Central Missouri. In the 1970s and early 1980s KLIK was known as the Live 95 as its broadcasts were all programmed by live deejays, talk hosts and newscasters rather than by a satellite or automation system. KLIK once operated with an FM sister station in the 1970s and 1980s known was KJFF 106.9 FM a 100,000 watt semi-automated easy listening music station with a large regional coverage signal. In the early 1980s KLIK and KJFF-FM together were sold by the local Jefferson City operators to a regional group broadcaster, and newspaper publisher, Brill Media. In about 1982, KJFF-FM 106.9 FM became an adult contemporary music station, initially with a satellite delivered music format, and easy listening music was phased out along with the KJFF call letters which were replaced by the new FM call signs of KTXY. KLIK 950 AM transitioned over from AC/Contemporary music at about the same time to a 24-hour-a-day live country/western format known as 95 Country. KLIK carried a variety of programming and a mostly country music format until the late 1990s.",
            "Two Towers, Bologna\nThe Two Towers (Italian: \"Le due torri\" ), both of them leaning, are the symbol of Bologna, Italy, and the most prominent of the Towers of Bologna. They are located at the intersection of the roads that lead to the five gates of the old ring wall (\"mura dei torresotti\"). The taller one is called the \"Asinelli\" while the smaller but more leaning tower is called the \"Garisenda\". Their names derive from the families which are traditionally credited for their construction between 1109 and 1119. Their construction was a competition between the two families to show which was the more powerful family. However, the scarcity of documents from this early period makes this in reality rather uncertain. The name of the Asinelli family, for example, is documented for the first time actually only in 1185, almost 70 years after the presumed construction of the tower which is attributed to them.",

Prior to the construction of Liberty Place, there was a \"gentlemen's agreement\" not to build any structure in Center City higher than the statue of William Penn on top of Philadelphia City Hall. The tradition lasted until 1984 when developer Willard G. Rouse III of Rouse & Associates announced plans to build an office building complex that included two towers taller than City Hall. There was a great amount of opposition to the construction of the towers with critics believing breaking the height limit would lead to construction of many more tall skyscrapers, ruining the livability and charm of Center City. Despite the opposition, construction of One Liberty Place was approved and the first phase of the project began in 1985 and was completed in 1987. When One Liberty Place was completed, it was the tallest skyscraper in Philadelphia.",
