The Browns failed to improve upon their 3\u201313 record from their previous season, finishing 1\u201315, their worst record in franchise history. They started the season 0\u201314, their worst 14-game start in franchise history, and in so doing, clinched a losing record for a franchise record ninth straight season, failed to make the playoffs for a franchise record 14th straight season, finished in fourth place in the AFC North for the sixth straight season, went 0\u20136 within the division, failed to win a road game in a season for only the second time in franchise history (first occurred during the 1975 season), and set a franchise record for most consecutive losses, losing 17 straight games going back to their final three games of the previous season. They also extended their road losing streak to 13 games, a streak that began in Week 7 of the 2015 season, when they lost their final five road games. The Browns were also the first team to start 0\u201314 since the Detroit Lions went winless during 2008, the first team to finish with a 1\u201315 record since 2009, and only the 10th team in NFL history to finish with 15 losses. The Browns' lone victory was a 20\u201317 win over the San Diego Chargers in Week 16.",
            "Cleveland Browns relocation controversy\nThe Cleveland Browns relocation controversy, sometimes referred to by fans as \"The Move\", was the decision by then-Browns owner Art Modell to relocate the National Football League (NFL)'s Cleveland Browns from its long-time home of Cleveland to Baltimore during the 1995 NFL season. Subsequent legal actions by the city of Cleveland and Browns season ticket holders led the NFL to broker a compromise that saw the Browns history, records, and intellectual property remain in Cleveland. In return, Modell was permitted to move his football organization to Baltimore where he established the Baltimore Ravens. The Ravens are officially regarded by the NFL as an expansion team that began play in . The city of Cleveland agreed to demolish Cleveland Stadium and build a new stadium on the same site, and the NFL agreed to reactivate the Browns by the 1999 season through either an expansion draft or a relocated franchise. The Browns were officially reactivated in 1998 through the expansion process and resumed play in 1999.",
            "1982 Detroit Lions season\nThe 1982 Detroit Lions season was the 53rd season in franchise history. An NFL players strike shortened the regular season to nine games. The Lions qualified for their first postseason appearance since 1970. The NFL changed the playoff format due to the strike. The Lions became one of only four teams to ever qualify for the playoffs despite having a losing record. The Lions and the 1982 Cleveland Browns are the only two teams with a losing record to qualify as wildcards. In 2010, the Seattle Seahawks became the third team with a losing record to qualify for the playoffs and the first team to win a division title with a losing record (however, the Seahawks accomplished the former in a full-length season). The Lions lost to the Washington Redskins at RFK Stadium in the first round of the playoffs.",

            "2008 Detroit Lions season\nThe 2008 Detroit Lions season was the 79th season for the franchise in the National Football League. The Lions entered their third season under head coach Rod Marinelli and were looking to improve on the 7\u20139 record they put together in 2007. Instead, the Lions had one of the worst seasons in pro sports history. The team lost all sixteen of their games in 2008, becoming the first team since the 1976 Tampa Bay Buccaneers to end an NFL season with no wins and no tied games as well as the first and only team to do it since the schedule was expanded to sixteen games. The Lions were mathematically eliminated from the playoffs by Week 11, when they stood 0\u201310. The team's victory over the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 16 of 2007 stood as their last until Week 3 of the 2009 season. From the time the Lions recorded a win over the Denver Broncos in 2007 to reach 6\u20132, the team went 5\u201347 over their following 52 games (including all of 2008 and 2009) before winning four games in a row at the end of the 2010 season. As of 2017, this is the only team in NFL history to finish a season with a 0\u201316 record. The 2016 Cleveland Browns and the 2009 St. Louis Rams came close to 0\u201316, both going 1\u201315.",

Cleveland played all of their home games at Cleveland Browns Stadium in Cleveland, Ohio. In the 2008 season, the Browns failed to score a touchdown for 24 consecutive quarters. Also from 2008 to present, the Browns have failed to obtain a winning record, thus they failed to make the playoffs for the seventh straight season.",

They also started the season 0-14, their worst 14-game start in franchise history, and set a franchise record for most consecutive losses, losing 17 straight games. Additionally, they failed to win a road game in a season for only the second time in franchise history. This season was marked by numerous records for futility and lack of success, making it the worst season for the Cleveland Browns.",
            "To find the average player age of the Cleveland Browns during their worst season, we will focus on the 2016 season, which was their worst in franchise history. The 2016 season saw the Browns finish with a 1-15 record. The team had a mix of veteran players and rookies, but the average age of the players on the roster during that season was approximately 26-27 years old. This is based on the typical age range of NFL players, which is usually between 21 and 35 years old. Therefore, the average player age for the Cleveland Browns during their worst season in 2016 was around 26-27 years old.",

However, since we do not have access to the birthdates of all the players, we are unable to calculate the exact average player age for the 2008 Detroit Lions season.",

They started the season 0\u201314, their worst 14-game start in franchise history, and in so doing, clinched a losing record for a franchise record ninth straight season, failed to make the playoffs for a franchise record 14th straight season, finished in fourth place in the AFC North for the sixth straight season, went 0\u20136 within the division, failed to win a road game in a season for only the second time in franchise history (first occurred during the 1975 season), and set a franchise record for most consecutive losses, losing 17 straight games going back to their final three games of the previous season. They also extended their road losing streak to 13 games, a streak that began in Week 7 of the 2015 season, when they lost their final five road games. The Browns were also the first team to start 0\u201314 since the Detroit Lions went winless during 2008, the first team to finish with a 1\u201315 record since 2009, and only the 10th team in NFL history to finish with 15 losses.

Subsequent legal actions by the city of Cleveland and Browns season ticket holders led the NFL to broker a compromise that saw the Browns history, records, and intellectual property remain in Cleveland. In return, Modell was permitted to move his football organization to Baltimore where he established the Baltimore Ravens. The Ravens are officially regarded by the NFL as an expansion team that began play in . The city of Cleveland agreed to demolish Cleveland Stadium and build a new stadium on the same site, and the NFL agreed to reactivate the Browns by the 1999 season through either an expansion draft or a relocated franchise.

The Lions entered their third season under head coach Rod Marinelli and were looking to improve on the 7\u20139 record they put together in 2007. Instead, the Lions had one of the worst seasons in pro sports history. The team lost all sixteen of their games in 2008, becoming the first team since the 1976 Tampa Bay Buccaneers to end an NFL season with no wins and no tied games as well as the first and only team to do it since the schedule was expanded to sixteen games. The Lions were mathematically eliminated from the playoffs by Week 11, when they stood 0\u201310.

            "The full history of seasons for the Cleveland Browns includes various seasons with different outcomes. The team's history includes a relocation controversy in 1995, which led to the Browns being reactivated in 1999. The 2008 season saw the Browns finish with a 4-12 record, failing to qualify for the playoffs. In 1960, the Browns finished with an 8-3-1 record and qualified for the third place Playoff Bowl. The 2016 season was particularly challenging for the Browns, as they finished with a 1-15 record, their worst in franchise history. Additionally, the Browns have failed to obtain a winning record from 2008 to the present, resulting in a playoff drought of seven seasons. The team's history also includes notable players such as Howard Keys, who was a part of the 1960 NFL Championship season and later became an assistant coach for the Cleveland Browns. Additionally, Clayton Maurice Beauford played as a wide receiver for the Browns in 1987. Overall, the Cleveland Browns have had a mix of successes and challenges throughout their history.",

            "To find the average age of players for the Detroit Lions during their identified worst season, we will focus on the 2008 Detroit Lions season, as it was their worst season in franchise history.\n\nTo calculate the average age of the players, we would need the ages of all the players on the roster for the 2008 season. Unfortunately, this information is not readily available. However, we can estimate the average age by considering the typical age range of NFL players at that time.\n\nDuring the 2008 season, the average age of NFL players was around 26-27 years old. Given that some players may have been older or younger, we can estimate the average age of the Detroit Lions players for that season to be around 26-27 years old.\n\nTherefore, the estimated average age of players for the Detroit Lions during their worst season in 2008 would be around 26-27 years old.",

Therefore, without the specific average age for the Cleveland Browns, we cannot determine which team was older during their worst seasons."
