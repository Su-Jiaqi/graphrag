The task is broken into identifying Talbot's service (which might involve retrieving his biography or historical service records) and then determining the current meeting place of that state\u2019s legislature. Two parallel paths are established at first: identifying his state (using either direct records retrieval about the legislature he served in or details of his service records) and culminating in using both methods to ensure accuracy and comprehensive coverage of the state information."
