            "Messin' with the Boys\nMessin' with the Boys is the second post-Runaways album by Cherie Currie, released in 1980 For this album Currie worked with her identical twin sister, Marie Currie. Their band was called \"Cherie and Marie Currie\". Marie was a guest vocalist on Cherie's first album, so Marie went on tour with Cherie to support her first album, \"Beauty's Only Skin Deep\". When Marie would join Cherie on stage to sing the encores the audience would go wild. So Cherie ran with the idea of two blonds are better than one. The idea paid off because \"Messin' with the Boys\" received more radio play than \"Beauty's Only Skin Deep\", and their song \"Since You Been Gone\" made it to 95 on US charts. The single \"This Time\" and the album Messin' with the Boys made the top 200 on U.S. charts. This makes Messin' with the Boys Cherie Currie's most successful album. \"I Just Love the Feeling\" originally surfaced on the 1974 album, \"S.S. Fools\" by the group of the same name. Cherie duetted with that group's lead singer, Bobby Kimball, and wrote the additional lyrics in the second verse.",

Stereotypes are victim of prejudice when negative portrayals of a group are untrue of individual members. Nursing has been stereotyped throughout the history of the profession. A common misconception is that all nurses are female; this has led to the stereotype of male nurses as effeminate. These generalized ideas of the nursing profession have formed a skewed image of nurses in the media.

The over-sexualized nurse is commonly referred to as a naughty nurse and is shown as a sex symbol or nymphomaniac. Along with these common stereotypes, studies have identified several other popular images used in media such as handmaiden, angel, torturer, homosexual male, alcoholic, buffoon and woman in white. Common stereotypes of nursing and portrayal of these misconceptions have fueled a discussion on the effects they have on the profession, harmful or good.",
