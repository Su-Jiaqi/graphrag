In order to calculate the position line, the time of the sight must be known so that the celestial position i.e. the Greenwich Hour Angle (Celestial Longitude - measured in a westerly direction from Greenwich) and Declination (Celestial Latitude - measured north or south of the equational or celestial equator), of the observed celestial body is known. All that can be derived from a single sight is a single position line, which can be achieved at any time during daylight, when both the sea horizon and the sun are visible. To achieve a fix, more than one celestial body and the sea horizon must be visible. This is usually only possible at dawn and dusk.",

            "Classifying space\nIn mathematics, specifically in homotopy theory, a classifying space \"BG\" of a topological group \"G\" is the quotient of a weakly contractible space \"EG\" (i.e. a topological space for which all its homotopy groups are trivial) by a proper free action of \"G\". It has the property that any \"G\" principal bundle over a paracompact manifold is isomorphic to a pullback of the principal bundle \"EG\" \u2192 \"BG\". As explained later, this means that classifying spaces represent a set-valued functor on the homotopy category of topological spaces. The term classifying space can also be used for spaces that represent a set-valued functor on the category of topological spaces, such as Sierpi\u0144ski space. This notion is generalized by the notion of classifying topos. However, the rest of this article discusses the more commonly used notion of classifying space up to homotopy.",

            "Classifying space\nIn mathematics, specifically in homotopy theory, a classifying space \"BG\" of a topological group \"G\" is the quotient of a weakly contractible space \"EG\" (i.e. a topological space for which all its homotopy groups are trivial) by a proper free action of \"G\". It has the property that any \"G\" principal bundle over a paracompact manifold is isomorphic to a pullback of the principal bundle \"EG\" \u2192 \"BG\". As explained later, this means that classifying spaces represent a set-valued functor on the homotopy category of topological spaces. The term classifying space can also be used for spaces that represent a set-valued functor on the category of topological spaces, such as Sierpi\u0144ski space. This notion is generalized by the notion of classifying topos. However, the rest of this article discusses the more commonly used notion of classifying space up to homotopy.",
