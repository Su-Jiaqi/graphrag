            "Guido Coen\nGuido Coen (1915\u20132010) was an Italian-born British film producer and film subtitler. He and his family were interned in Douglas on the Isle of Man during the Second World War. He began his career working for Filippo Del Giudice and Two Cities Films. When Two Cities was absorbed into the Rank Organisation in the mid-1940s Coen was employed by Sir David Cunynghame of London Film Productions as a subtitler. As Coen later described it in an interview, he did not know anything about subtitling at the time, and learned on the job: I finally got a phone call from London Films, Sir Cunnyngham, that 's it, who asked me whether I had ever subtitles pictures. I immediately said I had when in point of fact I did not know what he meant, and there was a young man in the office with Sir David Cunnynghame called Lew Watt, and he said Lew Watt will do the technical side and we want you to subtitle an Italian picture in to English. I said certainly . I came out of his office and Lew Watt said to me you don't know what they're talking about do you, I said you're quite right, he said well I'll show you. And I started subtitling pictures with Lew Watt, I used to do the literary side, and he used to do the technical side, the spotting, and lengths, and we together did subtitles for 40 or 50 pictures. The funny thing was we subtitled pictures in Chinese, in Indian and for the Chinese picture I had to have a Chinese waiter with me to tell me where the subtitles [...] I had the Italian dialogue and I had the picture, they gave me a film and we did the spotting together with Lew Watt and the measurements and I used to type the script. We had the film, we had the print which used to run on the two sided thing. And Lew Watt was working all the day so we had to do this at night, so we either used to work at night till 2 o'clock in the morning or we used to work at the weekends. There was always the problem that the Movieola might break down and so we had spare keys of other cutting rooms in in elm St in case we were caught. And that was how we started.Coen later founded his own company Kenilworth Film Productions and spent most of the post-war years producing second features. He made a dozen films in partnership with the director Charles Saunders. He later produced the 1971 horror film \"Burke & Hare\" and the comedies \"Au Pair Girls\" and \"Intimate Games.\"",

            "NaGISA\nNaGISA (Natural Geography in Shore Areas or Natural Geography of In-Shore Areas) is an international collaborative effort aimed at inventorying, cataloguing, and monitoring biodiversity of the in-shore area. So named for the Japanese word \"nagisa\" (\"where the land meets the sea\"), it is an Apronym. NaGISA is the first project of the larger CoML effort (Census of Marine Life) to have global participation in actual field work. The actual procedures of this project involve inexpensive collection equipment (for easy universal participation). This equipment is used to photograph sampling sites, to actually take samples from the sites, and to process these samples. At each site throughout the world, samples are taken from the intertidal zone out to a depth of 10 meters (and optionally out to 20 meters depth). These samples are then processed (the organisms are isolated) and then analyzed and catalogued. The information (regarding the kind and number of organisms analyzed) is sent to the global headquarters of NaGISA- the University of Kyoto in Japan. All of this information is then collated on the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS website). The end goal of the larger CoML effort is to find what \"was\", what \"is\", and what \"will be\" in the world's oceans. For NaGISA the goal is to find this in the world's in-shore areas.",

            "El Rollo\nAn El Rollo (Spanish for \"The Roll\") is a bodyboarding trick performed when the bodyboarder hits the lip of the wave and uses its power to throw himself out with the lip in a perfect arc to complete a roll before landing on the wave surface or into the white water. When the bodyboarder detaches completely from the wave surface or the lip the trick is called an \"air roll\" or \"aerial roll\". Other variations include the \"barrel roll\" where the roll is completed inside the barrel, and the \"rollo takeoff\" which is performed while catching the wave. This trick was named by someone in the industry. I remember the story where Pat Caldwell did the roll and Jack Lindholm or whoever saw him do it and commented \"what do you call that an el rollo\". Photos of the new move and captions started appearing in Bodyboarding Magazine. The move and the term caught on and spread around the world.",
            "Work college\nWork colleges are distinctive liberal arts colleges in the United States that promote the purposeful integration of work, learning, and service. At a work college all students work regardless of their academic program or their financial need. A work college is a public or private non-profit, four-year degree-granting institution of higher learning where student work is an integrated, essential and federally required core component of the educational work-learning-service program. Unlike Federal Work Study, which is solely need-based, work colleges do not differentiate between those that can afford to pay for their education from those that must work to cover their educational costs. At work colleges, students are regularly evaluated and assessed on their work performance and can be dismissed from the institution for non-performance in the work program. Students do not have the ability to \"buy\" their way out of the work requirement. Students perform essential institutional functions in every area imaginable on their campuses and gain a strong sense of ownership and responsibility for their campus community. Student labor enables work colleges to be far more operationally efficient and administratively lean (compared to more traditional colleges). This, in turn, contributes to lower operational costs which results in lower \u2013 and more affordable \u2013 tuition.",
            "See Yourself\n\"See Yourself\" is a song by English musician George Harrison, released on his 1976 album \"Thirty Three & 1/3\". Harrison began writing the song in 1967, while he was a member of the Beatles, in response to the public outcry surrounding bandmate Paul McCartney's admission that he had taken the hallucinogenic drug LSD. McCartney's announcement created a reaction in the press similar to that caused in 1966 by John Lennon's statement that the Beatles were more popular than Christianity. In its finished form, the song's lyrics advocate self-awareness and consideration for the consequences of one's actions. Musically, the composition contains unusual shifts in time signature from standard 4/4 to 9/8, while the songwords reflect the era of its genesis by recalling themes first espoused in the Beatles tracks \"Within You Without You\" and \"All You Need Is Love\"."

These samples are then processed (the organisms are isolated) and then analyzed and catalogued. The information (regarding the kind and number of organisms analyzed) is sent to the global headquarters of NaGISA- the University of Kyoto in Japan.

As Coen later described it in an interview, he did not know anything about subtitling at the time, and learned on the job: I finally got a phone call from London Films, Sir Cunnyngham, that 's it, who asked me whether I had ever subtitles pictures. I immediately said I had when in point of fact I did not know what he meant, and there was a young man in the office with Sir David Cunnynghame called Lew Watt, and he said Lew Watt will do the technical side and we want you to subtitle an Italian picture in to English. I said certainly . I came out of his office and Lew Watt said to me you don't know what they're talking about do you, I said you're quite right, he said well I'll show you. And I started subtitling pictures with Lew Watt, I used to do the literary side, and he used to do the technical side, the spotting, and lengths, and we together did subtitles for 40 or 50 pictures. The funny thing was we subtitled pictures in Chinese, in Indian and for the Chinese picture I had to have a Chinese waiter with me to tell me where the subtitles [...] I had the Italian dialogue and I had the picture, they gave me a film and we did the spotting together with Lew Watt and the measurements and I used to type the script. We had the film, we had the print which used to run on the two sided thing. And Lew Watt was working all the day so we had to do this at night, so we either used to work at night till 2 o'clock in the morning or we used to work at the weekends. There was always the problem that the Movieola might break down and so we had spare keys of other cutting rooms in in elm St in case we were caught. And that was how we started.Coen later founded his own company Kenilworth Film Productions and spent most of the post-war years producing second features.
