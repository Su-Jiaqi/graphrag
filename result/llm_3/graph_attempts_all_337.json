A native of California, Ms. Watts was born as Linda Heather Watts in Long Beach on September 27, 1953. As a little girl, she was a troublemaking child. She had always wanted to be an actress.

She moved permanently to New York at age 15, again on a Ford Foundation scholarship to the School of American Ballet. Watts joined the New York City Ballet in 1970 and was promoted to principal dancer by company founder George Balanchine in 1979. George Balanchine took Watts into his companies \"because he would not let such a talent disappear.\" During Ms. Watts's tenure with the company, she had numerous principal roles created for her by George Balanchine, Jerome Robbins, and Peter Martins among others. Mr. Balanchine gave Ms. Watts the principal roles in many of his existing masterpieces, including \"Agon\", Concerto Barocco, \"Apollo\", Symphony in C, \"Theme and Variations\" and \"Serenade\". Ms. Watts performed around the world and starred in numerous \"Dance in America\" television programs, and she performed opposite frequent partner Mikhail Baryshnikov at the White House in a national televised performance of Balanchine's \"Rubies\" for President and Mrs. Carter.

Gisella Caccialanza, the wife of Lew Christensen, danced the r\u00f4le of the Sugar Plum Fairy.

Perhaps choreographers will make up for lost time from now on.\" The company was the first in the U.S. to make the ballet an annual tradition, and for ten years, the only company in the United States performing the complete ballet, until George Balanchine's production opened in New York in 1954.

Watts joined the New York City Ballet in 1970 and was promoted to principal dancer by company founder George Balanchine in 1979. George Balanchine took Watts into his companies \"because he would not let such a talent disappear.\" During Ms. Watts's tenure with the company, she had numerous principal roles created for her by George Balanchine, Jerome Robbins, and Peter Martins among others. Mr. Balanchine gave Ms. Watts the principal roles in many of his existing masterpieces, including \"Agon\", Concerto Barocco, \"Apollo\", Symphony in C, \"Theme and Variations\" and \"Serenade\".

He choreographed his first (of 8) ballets for the NYC Ballet under Balanchine at age 20 thus making him the 2nd youngest choreographer in history ever to be attached to a major company. The first was Balanchine himself who was 20 yrs-old when he choreographed his first ballet for Serge Diaghilev's \"Ballets Russes.\" During his time with Balanchine, in his early 20's, he also was a guest choreographer with co's ranging from the San Francisco Ballet, to the Royal Winnipeg Ballet, to the Deutsche Oper Ballet in Berlin. Clifford's works were also featured in many TV shows and movies, such as \"Flashdance,\" \"The Man Who Loved Women,\" and TV series such as \"Dynasty,\" \"Glitter,\" and other shows produced by Blake Edwards and Aaron Spelling.",

            "The 1942 film Casablanca has a rich history and has had a significant impact on popular culture. The film, directed by Michael Curtiz, is a romantic drama set during World War II and stars iconic actors such as Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman. It tells the story of an American expatriate in Casablanca who must choose between his love for a woman and helping her husband, a Czech Resistance leader, escape the city.\n\nThe film has been referenced in various forms of media, including the 2017 Moroccan drama film Razzia, which is set in Casablanca and features discussions about the 1942 film. Additionally, the Los Angeles Dance Theater was commissioned by Warner Bros. to create a live-stage dance version of Casablanca, which premiered in Beijing in 2005.\n\nThe impact of Casablanca extends beyond the world of film and theater. The soundtrack to the 1980 film Foxes was released on the disco label Casablanca Records, and the film Yes, Madam, an Italian romance film from 1942, also shares the same name as the iconic film.\n\nFurthermore, the origins of Islam and the rise of the Arab Empire, which are explored in Tom Holland's book \"In the Shadow of the Sword\" and the documentary \"Islam: The Untold Story,\" are also relevant to the historical context of Casablanca, as the film is set in a Vichy-controlled city during World War II.\n\nOverall, the history and origins of the 1942 film Casablanca have had a lasting impact on popular culture and continue to be referenced and explored in various forms of media.",

He was also responsible for founding the American Ballet, the first professional ballet company in the United States. Balanchine's influence extended beyond his own companies, as he also mentored and collaborated with choreographers such as John Clifford, who went on to have a successful career in dance.

I immediately said I had when in point of fact I did not know what he meant, and there was a young man in the office with Sir David Cunnynghame called Lew Watt, and he said Lew Watt will do the technical side and we want you to subtitle an Italian picture in to English. I said certainly . I came out of his office and Lew Watt said to me you don't know what they're talking about do you, I said you're quite right, he said well I'll show you. And I started subtitling pictures with Lew Watt, I used to do the literary side, and he used to do the technical side, the spotting, and lengths, and we together did subtitles for 40 or 50 pictures. The funny thing was we subtitled pictures in Chinese, in Indian and for the Chinese picture I had to have a Chinese waiter with me to tell me where the subtitles [...] I had the Italian dialogue and I had the picture, they gave me a film and we did the spotting together with Lew Watt and the measurements and I used to type the script. We had the film, we had the print which used to run on the two sided thing. And Lew Watt was working all the day so we had to do this at night, so we either used to work at night till 2 o'clock in the morning or we used to work at the weekends. There was always the problem that the Movieola might break down and so we had spare keys of other cutting rooms in in elm St in case we were caught.

So named for the Japanese word \"nagisa\" (\"where the land meets the sea\"), it is an Apronym. NaGISA is the first project of the larger CoML effort (Census of Marine Life) to have global participation in actual field work. The actual procedures of this project involve inexpensive collection equipment (for easy universal participation). This equipment is used to photograph sampling sites, to actually take samples from the sites, and to process these samples. At each site throughout the world, samples are taken from the intertidal zone out to a depth of 10 meters (and optionally out to 20 meters depth). These samples are then processed (the organisms are isolated) and then analyzed and catalogued. The information (regarding the kind and number of organisms analyzed) is sent to the global headquarters of NaGISA- the University of Kyoto in Japan. All of this information is then collated on the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS website). The end goal of the larger CoML effort is to find what \"was\", what \"is\", and what \"will be\" in the world's oceans. For NaGISA the goal is to find this in the world's in-shore areas.",

When the bodyboarder detaches completely from the wave surface or the lip the trick is called an \"air roll\" or \"aerial roll\". Other variations include the \"barrel roll\" where the roll is completed inside the barrel, and the \"rollo takeoff\" which is performed while catching the wave. This trick was named by someone in the industry. I remember the story where Pat Caldwell did the roll and Jack Lindholm or whoever saw him do it and commented \"what do you call that an el rollo\".

            "Work college\nWork colleges are distinctive liberal arts colleges in the United States that promote the purposeful integration of work, learning, and service. At a work college all students work regardless of their academic program or their financial need. A work college is a public or private non-profit, four-year degree-granting institution of higher learning where student work is an integrated, essential and federally required core component of the educational work-learning-service program. Unlike Federal Work Study, which is solely need-based, work colleges do not differentiate between those that can afford to pay for their education from those that must work to cover their educational costs. At work colleges, students are regularly evaluated and assessed on their work performance and can be dismissed from the institution for non-performance in the work program. Students do not have the ability to \"buy\" their way out of the work requirement. Students perform essential institutional functions in every area imaginable on their campuses and gain a strong sense of ownership and responsibility for their campus community. Student labor enables work colleges to be far more operationally efficient and administratively lean (compared to more traditional colleges). This, in turn, contributes to lower operational costs which results in lower \u2013 and more affordable \u2013 tuition.",
            "See Yourself\n\"See Yourself\" is a song by English musician George Harrison, released on his 1976 album \"Thirty Three & 1/3\". Harrison began writing the song in 1967, while he was a member of the Beatles, in response to the public outcry surrounding bandmate Paul McCartney's admission that he had taken the hallucinogenic drug LSD. McCartney's announcement created a reaction in the press similar to that caused in 1966 by John Lennon's statement that the Beatles were more popular than Christianity. In its finished form, the song's lyrics advocate self-awareness and consideration for the consequences of one's actions. Musically, the composition contains unusual shifts in time signature from standard 4/4 to 9/8, while the songwords reflect the era of its genesis by recalling themes first espoused in the Beatles tracks \"Within You Without You\" and \"All You Need Is Love\"."

Additionally, he took Heather Watts into his companies and created principal roles for her in many of his masterpieces. Therefore, the American Ballet is the production company founded by George Balanchine associated with stage productions during that era.",
            "Based on the synthesized information from nodes 1, 2, and 4, it can be determined that George Balanchine's company, the American Ballet, was not directly involved in the stage production of Casablanca. However, the Los Angeles Dance Theater, which was founded by John Clifford, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Balanchine, was requested by Warner Bros. Theatre Ventures, Inc. to create a live-stage dance version of the film \"Casablanca.\" This indicates an indirect involvement of Balanchine through his influence on Clifford and his connection to the Los Angeles Dance Theater. Therefore, while Balanchine's company was not directly involved, his influence can be seen in the production through the involvement of the Los Angeles Dance Theater."

A native of California, Ms. Watts was born as Linda Heather Watts in Long Beach on September 27, 1953. As a little girl, she was a troublemaking child. She had always wanted to be an actress. An acting coach advised her taking ballet classes, seeing as she was incredibly dramatic (and clumsy). She started dancing at the age of 10, came to New York at the age of 13 on a Ford Foundation summer scholarship to attend the School of American Ballet, the official school of the New York City Ballet. She moved permanently to New York at age 15, again on a Ford Foundation scholarship to the School of American Ballet. Watts joined the New York City Ballet in 1970 and was promoted to principal dancer by company founder George Balanchine in 1979. George Balanchine took Watts into his companies \"because he would not let such a talent disappear.\" During Ms. Watts's tenure with the company, she had numerous principal roles created for her by George Balanchine, Jerome Robbins, and Peter Martins among others. Mr. Balanchine gave Ms. Watts the principal roles in many of his existing masterpieces, including \"Agon\", Concerto Barocco, \"Apollo\", Symphony in C, \"Theme and Variations\" and \"Serenade\". Ms. Watts performed around the world and starred in numerous \"Dance in America\" television programs, and she performed opposite frequent partner Mikhail Baryshnikov at the White House in a national televised performance of Balanchine's \"Rubies\" for President and Mrs. Carter.

            "Too Darn Hot\n\"Too Darn Hot\" is a song written by Cole Porter for his musical \"Kiss Me, Kate\" (1948).

In the 1953 MGM Hollywood film version, it is moved to a much earlier point, and it is sung by Ann Miller (as Lois Lane, Fred's new girlfriend, who is cast as Bianca). The song does not really contribute to the plot in either the stage or film versions; in the stage version, the song represents the company of \"The Taming of the Shrew\" taking a break offstage during the intermission of their play; in the film version it allows the audience to see Lois's fun-loving, risk-taking nature, and gave Ann Miller a chance to show off her dancing skills, specifically tap. The line 'According to the Kinsey report' (in the original stage production) was changed in the film version to 'According to the latest report'. The song has also been covered by many artists.",

A native of California, Ms. Watts was born as Linda Heather Watts in Long Beach on September 27, 1953. As a little girl, she was a troublemaking child. She had always wanted to be an actress.

George Balanchine took Watts into his companies \"because he would not let such a talent disappear.\" During Ms. Watts's tenure with the company, she had numerous principal roles created for her by George Balanchine, Jerome Robbins, and Peter Martins among others. Mr. Balanchine gave Ms. Watts the principal roles in many of his existing masterpieces, including \"Agon\", Concerto Barocco, \"Apollo\", Symphony in C, \"Theme and Variations\" and \"Serenade\". Ms. Watts performed around the world and starred in numerous \"Dance in America\" television programs, and she performed opposite frequent partner Mikhail Baryshnikov at the White House in a national televised performance of Balanchine's \"Rubies\" for President and Mrs. Carter.

It provides Perkins' account of his career with engineering consulting firm Chas. T. Main in Boston. According to Perkins, his role at Main was to convince leaders of underdeveloped countries to accept substantial development loans for large construction and engineering projects that would primarily help the richest families and local elites, rather than the poor, while making sure that these projects were contracted to U.S. companies. Later these loans would give the U.S. political influence and access to natural resources for U.S. companies. He refers to this as an \"economic hit man.\" Although he states that throughout his career he has always worked for private companies, and suggests a system of corporatocracy and greed, rather than a single conspiracy, he claims the involvement of the National Security Agency (NSA), with whom he had interviewed for a job before joining Main. According to the author, this interview effectively constituted an independent screening which led to his subsequent hiring as an economic hit man by Einar Greve, a vice president of the firm (and alleged NSA liaison)."

The company was requested by Warner Bros. Theatre Ventures, Inc., the live theatre division of Warner Bros. Studios. The company was founded for the purpose of creating a live-stage dance version of the film \"Casablanca\". \"\"Casablanca, The Dance\"\" premiered in Beijing, China on the 5th of April, 2005 at the 10,000 seat \"Great Hall of the People\" to sold-out audiences and standing ovations. A projected world tour was cancelled when Warner Bros. ceased live theatre operations after the failure of their first Broadway musical, \"Lestat\". Later, Warner Bros. restarted producing musicals, fueling rumors about the revival of the \"Casablanca, The Dance,\" world tour.",
            "American Ballet\nThe American Ballet was the first professional ballet company George Balanchine created in the United States. The company was founded with the help of Lincoln Kirstein and Edward Warburg, managed by Alexander Merovitch and populated by students of Kirstein and Balanchine's School of American Ballet. Having failed to mount a tour, American Ballet began performing at the \"Old Met.\" After being allowed to stage only two dance performances (\"Orfeo and Eurydice\" in 1936 and an evening of dances choreographed to the music of Igor Stravinsky in 1937), Balanchine moved the company to Hollywood in 1938. The company was restarted as the American Ballet Caravan and toured North and South America, although it too folded after several years.",
            "Too Darn Hot\n\"Too Darn Hot\" is a song written by Cole Porter for his musical \"Kiss Me, Kate\" (1948). In the stage version, it is sung at the start of Act 2, and in the 1948 original Broadway production, it was sung by Lorenzo Fuller (as Paul) and Eddie Sledge and Fred Davis (as the specialty dancers), leading the full company. In the 1953 MGM Hollywood film version, it is moved to a much earlier point, and it is sung by Ann Miller (as Lois Lane, Fred's new girlfriend, who is cast as Bianca). The song does not really contribute to the plot in either the stage or film versions; in the stage version, the song represents the company of \"The Taming of the Shrew\" taking a break offstage during the intermission of their play; in the film version it allows the audience to see Lois's fun-loving, risk-taking nature, and gave Ann Miller a chance to show off her dancing skills, specifically tap. The line 'According to the Kinsey report' (in the original stage production) was changed in the film version to 'According to the latest report'. The song has also been covered by many artists.",

A native of California, Ms. Watts was born as Linda Heather Watts in Long Beach on September 27, 1953. As a little girl, she was a troublemaking child. She had always wanted to be an actress. An acting coach advised her taking ballet classes, seeing as she was incredibly dramatic (and clumsy). She started dancing at the age of 10, came to New York at the age of 13 on a Ford Foundation summer scholarship to attend the School of American Ballet, the official school of the New York City Ballet. She moved permanently to New York at age 15, again on a Ford Foundation scholarship to the School of American Ballet. Watts joined the New York City Ballet in 1970 and was promoted to principal dancer by company founder George Balanchine in 1979. George Balanchine took Watts into his companies \"because he would not let such a talent disappear.\" During Ms. Watts's tenure with the company, she had numerous principal roles created for her by George Balanchine, Jerome Robbins, and Peter Martins among others. Mr. Balanchine gave Ms. Watts the principal roles in many of his existing masterpieces, including \"Agon\", Concerto Barocco, \"Apollo\", Symphony in C, \"Theme and Variations\" and \"Serenade\". Ms. Watts performed around the world and starred in numerous \"Dance in America\" television programs, and she performed opposite frequent partner Mikhail Baryshnikov at the White House in a national televised performance of Balanchine's \"Rubies\" for President and Mrs. Carter.

The game is a variation of Deuces Wild and is based on five card draw where the player is dealt a five card hand. The player can then choose which cards to keep or discard and is dealt new cards accordingly. The payoff is based on the value of the hand. The \"wild card\" is announced before the hand is dealt and can be substituted for any card in the deck according to what is most beneficial to the player's hand. Since the game uses a standard deck, there are always four \"wild cards\" in play. This allows the player greater flexibility in building a winning hand.",
            "I Love to Laugh\n\"I Love to Laugh\", also called \"We Love to Laugh\", is a song from Walt Disney's film \"Mary Poppins\". It was composed by Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman. The song is sung in the film by \"Uncle Albert\" (Ed Wynn), and \"Bert\" (Dick Van Dyke) as they levitate uncontrollably toward the ceiling, eventually joined by Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews) herself. The premise of the scene, that laughter and happiness cause Uncle Albert (and like-minded visitors) to float into the air, can be seen as a metaphor for the way laughter can \"lighten\" a mood. (Compare Peter Pan's flight power, which is also powered by happy thoughts.) Conversely, thinking of something sad literally brings Albert and his visitors \"down to earth\" again. The song states a case strongly in favor of laughter, even if Mary Poppins appears to disapprove of Uncle Albert's behavior, especially since it not only complicates the task of getting Albert down, but the infectious mood sends Bert and the Banks children into the air as well.",

So named for the Japanese word \"nagisa\" (\"where the land meets the sea\"), it is an Apronym. NaGISA is the first project of the larger CoML effort (Census of Marine Life) to have global participation in actual field work. The actual procedures of this project involve inexpensive collection equipment (for easy universal participation). This equipment is used to photograph sampling sites, to actually take samples from the sites, and to process these samples. At each site throughout the world, samples are taken from the intertidal zone out to a depth of 10 meters (and optionally out to 20 meters depth). These samples are then processed (the organisms are isolated) and then analyzed and catalogued. The information (regarding the kind and number of organisms analyzed) is sent to the global headquarters of NaGISA- the University of Kyoto in Japan. All of this information is then collated on the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS website). The end goal of the larger CoML effort is to find what \"was\", what \"is\", and what \"will be\" in the world's oceans. For NaGISA the goal is to find this in the world's in-shore areas.",

As Coen later described it in an interview, he did not know anything about subtitling at the time, and learned on the job: I finally got a phone call from London Films, Sir Cunnyngham, that 's it, who asked me whether I had ever subtitles pictures. I immediately said I had when in point of fact I did not know what he meant, and there was a young man in the office with Sir David Cunnynghame called Lew Watt, and he said Lew Watt will do the technical side and we want you to subtitle an Italian picture in to English. I said certainly . I came out of his office and Lew Watt said to me you don't know what they're talking about do you, I said you're quite right, he said well I'll show you. And I started subtitling pictures with Lew Watt, I used to do the literary side, and he used to do the technical side, the spotting, and lengths, and we together did subtitles for 40 or 50 pictures. The funny thing was we subtitled pictures in Chinese, in Indian and for the Chinese picture I had to have a Chinese waiter with me to tell me where the subtitles [...] I had the Italian dialogue and I had the picture, they gave me a film and we did the spotting together with Lew Watt and the measurements and I used to type the script. We had the film, we had the print which used to run on the two sided thing. And Lew Watt was working all the day so we had to do this at night, so we either used to work at night till 2 o'clock in the morning or we used to work at the weekends. There was always the problem that the Movieola might break down and so we had spare keys of other cutting rooms in in elm St in case we were caught.
