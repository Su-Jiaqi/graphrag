            "Chick flick\nChick flick is a slang term for the film genre dealing mainly with love and romance which is targeted to a female audience. It can be specifically defined as a genre in which a woman is the protagonist. Although many types of films may be directed toward the female gender, \"chick flick\" is typically used only in reference to films that contain emotion or themes that are relationship-based (although not necessarily romantic as films may focus on parent-child or friend relationships). Chick flicks often are released \"en masse\" around Valentine's Day. The equivalent for male audiences is the guy-cry film. Feminists such as Gloria Steinem have objected to terms such as \"chick flick\" and the related term \"chick lit\" and a film critic has called the term \"chick flick\" derogatory.",

            "Chick flick\nChick flick is a slang term for the film genre dealing mainly with love and romance which is targeted to a female audience. It can be specifically defined as a genre in which a woman is the protagonist. Although many types of films may be directed toward the female gender, \"chick flick\" is typically used only in reference to films that contain emotion or themes that are relationship-based (although not necessarily romantic as films may focus on parent-child or friend relationships). Chick flicks often are released \"en masse\" around Valentine's Day. The equivalent for male audiences is the guy-cry film. Feminists such as Gloria Steinem have objected to terms such as \"chick flick\" and the related term \"chick lit\" and a film critic has called the term \"chick flick\" derogatory.",

The club initially participated in the Murray Ranges Football Association, temporarily shifting for one season (1925) to the Murray River Football Association before returning and in 1930 were renamed to Sedan Cambrai. In 1936 the club went into recess until after World War II, when in 1947 it reformed and joined the Barossa & Murray Valley Football Association, lasting for four seasons before going into recess again in 1951. In 1955 the club reformed again and returned to the Barossa & Murray Valley Association. Sedan Cambrai had a short affiliation with the Gawler and District Football Association's AII competition from 1957-1958 before shifting to the Torrens Valley Football Association AII competition in 1959. When the TVFA merged into the new Hills Football League in 1967, Sedan Cambrai joined the Northern Division and then were placed in the Division 2 competition when the Hills League was restructured in 1972. In 1975, Sedan Cambrai merged with the Mount Torrens Football Club to form the Mount Torrens Cambrai Football Club. This merger would only last for ten years before the club split back into Sedan Cambrai and Mount Torrens in 1986. The reformed Sedan Cambrai entered the Mid Murray Football Association and played in that competition until it disbanded at the end of the 2009 season when they returned to the Hills Football League Country Division (Division 2).

            "Chick flick\nChick flick is a slang term for the film genre dealing mainly with love and romance which is targeted to a female audience. It can be specifically defined as a genre in which a woman is the protagonist. Although many types of films may be directed toward the female gender, \"chick flick\" is typically used only in reference to films that contain emotion or themes that are relationship-based (although not necessarily romantic as films may focus on parent-child or friend relationships). Chick flicks often are released \"en masse\" around Valentine's Day. The equivalent for male audiences is the guy-cry film. Feminists such as Gloria Steinem have objected to terms such as \"chick flick\" and the related term \"chick lit\" and a film critic has called the term \"chick flick\" derogatory.",

            "Dissolved organic carbon\nDissolved organic carbon (DOC), sometimes known as dissolved organic material (DOM), is a broad classification for organic molecules of varied origin and composition within aquatic systems. The \"dissolved\" fraction of organic carbon is an operational classification. Many researchers use the term \"dissolved\" for compounds below 0.45 micrometers, but 0.22 micrometers is also common, saving colloidal for higher concentrations. A practical definition of dissolved typically used in marine chemistry is all substances that pass through a GF/F filter. The recommended measure technique is the HTCO technique after filtration on precombusted glass fiber filters, typically GF/F filters.",
            "Vegetation classification\nVegetation classification is the process of classifying and mapping the vegetation over an area of the earth's surface. Vegetation classification is often performed by state based agencies as part of land use, resource and environmental management. Many different methods of vegetation classification have been used. In general, there has been a shift from structural classification used by forestry for the mapping of timber resources, to floristic community mapping for biodiversity management. Whereas older forestry-based schemes considered factors such as height, species and density of the woody canopy, floristic community mapping shifts the emphasis onto ecological factors such as climate, soil type and floristic associations. Classification mapping is usually now done using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software.",
            "Prehypertension\nPrehypertension, also known as high normal blood pressure, is an American medical classification for cases where a person's blood pressure is elevated above normal, but not to the level considered hypertension (high blood pressure). Prehypertension is blood pressure readings with a systolic pressure from 120 to 139\u00a0mm Hg or a diastolic pressure from 80 to 89\u00a0mm Hg. Readings greater than or equal to 140/90\u00a0mm Hg are considered hypertension. Classification of blood pressure is based upon two or more readings at two or more separate occasions separated by at least one week. The seventh report of the Joint National Committee (JNC 7) proposed the new labeling for elevated blood pressure values below 140/90 to more accurately communicate the tendency of blood pressure to rise with age."
