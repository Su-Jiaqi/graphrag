                "output": "While both Herschell Gordon Lewis and Leah Meyerhoff have made significant contributions to the film industry, Herschell Gordon Lewis is considered a pioneer due to his groundbreaking impact on the horror and exploitation genres. His creation of the \"splatter\" subgenre of horror films and the influential \"Blood Feast\" solidified his place as the \"Godfather of Gore\" and had a lasting impact on the horror genre. Additionally, his influence on the distribution of exploitation films through \"Something Weird Video\" further solidifies his pioneering status.\n\nOn the other hand, Leah Meyerhoff's contributions to the film industry, while significant, are more focused on her storytelling and filmmaking skills, as well as her role in elevating the visibility of independent filmmakers and inspiring emerging filmmakers, particularly women. While her impact on the film festival circuit and independent cinema is noteworthy, it does not carry the same historical significance as Lewis' contributions to the creation of a subgenre and the distribution of exploitation films.\n\nIn conclusion, Herschell Gordon Lewis is considered a pioneer in the film industry due to his groundbreaking contributions to the horror and exploitation genres, while Leah Meyerhoff's impact, while significant, does not reach the same level of historical significance.",

            "Taxation in Spain\nTaxes in Spain are levied by national (federal), regional and local governments. Tax revenue in Spain stood at 36.3% of GDP in 2013. A wide range of taxes are levied on different sources, the most important ones being income tax, social security contributions, corporate tax, value added tax; some of them are applied at national level and others at national and regional levels. Most national and regional taxes are collected by the Agencia Estatal de Administraci\u00f3n Tributaria which is the bureau responsible for collecting taxes at the national level. Other minor taxes like property transfer tax (regional), real estate property tax (local), road tax (local) are collected directly by regional or local administrations. Four historical territories or foral provinces (Araba/\u00c1lava, Bizkaia, Gipuzkoa and Navarre) collect all national and regional taxes themselves and subsequently transfer the portion due to central Government after two negotiations called Concierto (in which the first three territories, that conform the Basque Autonomous Community, agree their defense jointly) and the Convenio (in which the territory and Community of Navarre defense itself alone). The tax year in Spain follows the calendar year. The tax collection method depends on the tax; some of them are collected by self-assessment, but others (i.e. income tax) follow a system of pay-as-you-earn tax with monthly withholdings that follow a self-assessment at the end of the term.",
