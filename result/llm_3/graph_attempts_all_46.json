            "United Church of Christ in Keene\nThe United Church of Christ in Keene (also known as The First Church or Church at the Head of the Square) is a historic Congregational church at 23 Central Square in Keene, New Hampshire, United States. The oldest portion of this church is its timber frame, a 50 by structure that was built in 1786 as the town's fourth meeting house. In 1828 the meeting house was rotated and moved, nearly to its present location, and the Greek Revival temple front with Doric columns was added, as was the tower and steeple. These alterations were supposedly inspired by the recent (1817\u201318) construction of the Third Fitzwilliam Meetinghouse. In 1859-60 the church was again moved, this time a short distance to make room for an enlarged sanctuary, as designed by the Worcester firm of Boyden & Ball. The building exterior has been little altered since; the steeple was recreated from photographs after the original was toppled by the New England Hurricane of 1938. In 1924 a two-story brick parish house was built next to the church.",

In 1828 the meeting house was rotated and moved, nearly to its present location, and the Greek Revival temple front with Doric columns was added, as was the tower and steeple. These alterations were supposedly inspired by the recent (1817\u201318) construction of the Third Fitzwilliam Meetinghouse. In 1859-60 the church was again moved, this time a short distance to make room for an enlarged sanctuary, as designed by the Worcester firm of Boyden & Ball. The building exterior has been little altered since; the steeple was recreated from photographs after the original was toppled by the New England Hurricane of 1938. In 1924 a two-story brick parish house was built next to the church.",
            "Hoxne manor\nHoxne manor in Suffolk, England was mentioned in the 1086 Domesday Survey as a seat of the East Anglian bishops, from around that date being the bishops of Norwich, a transition from the bishops of Thetford. The Domesday name of Hoxne hundred, annexed to the manor, was \"Bishop's Hundred\". At this point Herbert Losinga took Hoxne as a key location from which to compete with the Abbot of St Edmunds; he rededicated the church at Hoxne to honour Edmund the Martyr, and kept control of the Hoxne manor house, though himself locating elsewhere."
