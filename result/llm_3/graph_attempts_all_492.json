            "Induction (play)\nAn induction in a play is an explanatory scene, summary or other text that stands outside and apart from the main action with the intent to comment on it, moralize about it or in the case of dumb show to summarize the plot or underscore what is afoot. Typically, an induction precedes the main text of a play. Inductions are a common feature of plays written and performed in the Renaissance period, including those of Shakespeare. While Shakespeare plays do not typically have inductions, they are sometimes depicted as part of the device of the play within the play. Examples include the dumb show in \"Hamlet\" and the address to the audience by Puck in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\". Another example, in \"The Spanish Tragedy\" by Thomas Kyd, is the introduction to that play by the ghost of Andrea who preps the audience by laying out the story to come. Likewise, Shakespeare's \"The Taming of the Shrew\" opens with induction scenes which involve characters watching the play proper.",

            "Guido Coen\nGuido Coen (1915\u20132010) was an Italian-born British film producer and film subtitler. He and his family were interned in Douglas on the Isle of Man during the Second World War. He began his career working for Filippo Del Giudice and Two Cities Films. When Two Cities was absorbed into the Rank Organisation in the mid-1940s Coen was employed by Sir David Cunynghame of London Film Productions as a subtitler. As Coen later described it in an interview, he did not know anything about subtitling at the time, and learned on the job: I finally got a phone call from London Films, Sir Cunnyngham, that 's it, who asked me whether I had ever subtitles pictures. I immediately said I had when in point of fact I did not know what he meant, and there was a young man in the office with Sir David Cunnynghame called Lew Watt, and he said Lew Watt will do the technical side and we want you to subtitle an Italian picture in to English. I said certainly . I came out of his office and Lew Watt said to me you don't know what they're talking about do you, I said you're quite right, he said well I'll show you. And I started subtitling pictures with Lew Watt, I used to do the literary side, and he used to do the technical side, the spotting, and lengths, and we together did subtitles for 40 or 50 pictures. The funny thing was we subtitled pictures in Chinese, in Indian and for the Chinese picture I had to have a Chinese waiter with me to tell me where the subtitles [...] I had the Italian dialogue and I had the picture, they gave me a film and we did the spotting together with Lew Watt and the measurements and I used to type the script. We had the film, we had the print which used to run on the two sided thing. And Lew Watt was working all the day so we had to do this at night, so we either used to work at night till 2 o'clock in the morning or we used to work at the weekends. There was always the problem that the Movieola might break down and so we had spare keys of other cutting rooms in in elm St in case we were caught. And that was how we started.Coen later founded his own company Kenilworth Film Productions and spent most of the post-war years producing second features. He made a dozen films in partnership with the director Charles Saunders. He later produced the 1971 horror film \"Burke & Hare\" and the comedies \"Au Pair Girls\" and \"Intimate Games.\"",

            "Memory of Mankind\nSeveral motivations underlie the project. The primary ambition of MOM is to preserve an image of our era, created by numerous participants all over the planet. MOM will also contain information which our society is obliged to forward to the future: e.g. description of nuclear waste repositories. MOM collaborates with the NEA and SKB. Although the most obvious ambition and often described in the media is the concern about preserving our knowledge, this is not the primary goal of MOM. Serving as a time capsule MOM is both: in a time frame of millennia it is the story about us, and in a time frame of decades it is a backup. In times where global warming, nuclear danger and biological warfare threaten the existence of civilization, saving the core knowledge and culture acquired over centuries is a backup measure. In case of a collapse, the MOM project could help survivors to rebuild civilization. Linked to this, an another reason is of political order: facing the lack of reactivity of authorities concerning global warming, the MOM project is a reminder of what can happen. Roman and Greek civilizations whose histories have been reconstructed by the small percentage of texts and artifacts which survived until our days are examples that have inspired the MOM project. Finally, it's a critic of our digital civilization : according to Kunze, maybe nothing of the 21st century will last in the future, since most of our interactions are now virtual. The \"accuracy versus bullshit\" is one of the main themes of the MOM project, worried about loss of information, the project can only aim to save a fragment of the information produced until today, but this fragment has to be representative.",

Other variations include the \"barrel roll\" where the roll is completed inside the barrel, and the \"rollo takeoff\" which is performed while catching the wave.

            "I Love to Laugh\n\"I Love to Laugh\", also called \"We Love to Laugh\", is a song from Walt Disney's film \"Mary Poppins\". It was composed by Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman. The song is sung in the film by \"Uncle Albert\" (Ed Wynn), and \"Bert\" (Dick Van Dyke) as they levitate uncontrollably toward the ceiling, eventually joined by Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews) herself. The premise of the scene, that laughter and happiness cause Uncle Albert (and like-minded visitors) to float into the air, can be seen as a metaphor for the way laughter can \"lighten\" a mood. (Compare Peter Pan's flight power, which is also powered by happy thoughts.) Conversely, thinking of something sad literally brings Albert and his visitors \"down to earth\" again. The song states a case strongly in favor of laughter, even if Mary Poppins appears to disapprove of Uncle Albert's behavior, especially since it not only complicates the task of getting Albert down, but the infectious mood sends Bert and the Banks children into the air as well.",

The size and depth and of the postpipe can provide information as to any reuse of the posthole especially if several different postpipes can be identified. They can also indicate the species of wood used and help suggest the nature of the structure that the timber once supported.

            "Temperate forest\nTemperate forests correspond to forest concentration formed in the northern and southern hemisphere, or in temperate regions. It is the same as a tropical forest except for the climate and some of the animals adaptations. Main characteristics include: wide leaves, large and tall trees, large wild canopy and non seasonal vegetation. Temperate forests can be further distinguished by weather patterns and geographical features that favor the predominance of certain kinds of trees. In temperate coniferous forests, evergreen conifers predominate, while in temperate broadleaf and mixed forests, a more even distribution exists between evergreen trees and deciduous trees. Temperate deciduous forests, a subgroup of temperate broadleaf forests, consist of trees that lose their leaves every year. Finally, temperate rainforests typically have heavy rainfall and dense humidity. But in some temperate forests there are just trees with needles and do not shed their leaves during the winter, so the climate is a little different and not as cold. They are also known as montane forests.",

Finally, temperate rainforests typically have heavy rainfall and dense humidity. But in some temperate forests there are just trees with needles and do not shed their leaves during the winter, so the climate is a little different and not as cold. They are also known as montane forests.",
            "Temperate coniferous forest\nTemperate coniferous forest is a terrestrial biome found in temperate regions of the world with warm summers and cool winters and adequate rainfall to sustain a forest. In most temperate coniferous forests, evergreen conifers predominate, while some are a mix of conifers and broadleaf evergreen trees and/or broadleaf deciduous trees. Temperate evergreen forests are common in the coastal areas of regions that have mild winters and heavy rainfall, or inland in drier climates or mountain areas. Temperate coniferous forests are only found in the Northern Hemisphere in North America, Europe, and Asia. A separate ecoregion, the tropical coniferous forests, occurs in more tropical climates.",

            "Palouse National Forest\nThe Palouse Forest Reserve and after March 4, 1907, the Palouse National Forest was established by Presidential Proclamation (34 U.S. Statutes at Large 3293) on March 2, 1907 and was one of President Theodore Roosevelt's Midnight forests, created before the federal law banning new forest reserves in six western states, including Idaho, became effective. The conventional wisdom has the name \u2018palouse\u2019 being derived from the French term for the large treeless plain region in eastern Washington stretching into Idaho: the Palouse, a word meaning grassy spot or place. However, Boone says that the name could originate from the name of a major village of Palouse Indians, Palus, located at the confluence of the Palouse and Snake Rivers. 'Palus' is the Sachapin Indian word for \u201csomething sticking down in the water,\u201d in this case the something was a large rock, thought to be a beaver\u2019s heart, and which had an important religious significance for the Palouse Indians. The Palouse National Forest had its administrative headquarters in the town of Wallace, Idaho for its 15-month existence and was administered by the U.S. Forest Service with 194404 acre . With the issuance of Executive Order 843 by President Roosevelt on June 26, 1908, with an effective date of July 1, 1908, the entire forest was absorbed by the Coeur d'Alene National Forest and the area ceased to be an independently administered national forest. The lands of the former Palouse National Forest were then administered as part of the Coeur d\u2019Alene National Forest for three years before being combined with other lands to establish the St. Joe National Forest on July 1, 1911. The area of the former Palouse National Forest formed the western portion of the St. Joe National Forest. Once transferred in 1911, the area of the Palouse National Forest became the Palouse Ranger District of the St. Joe National Forest and is still considered part of the St. Joe National Forest. However, it has been administered by the Clearwater National Forest since the 1973 administrative merger of the Kaniksu National Forest, Coeur d\u2019Alene, and St. Joe National Forests into the Idaho Panhandle National Forests.",

NaGISA is the first project of the larger CoML effort (Census of Marine Life) to have global participation in actual field work. The actual procedures of this project involve inexpensive collection equipment (for easy universal participation). This equipment is used to photograph sampling sites, to actually take samples from the sites, and to process these samples. At each site throughout the world, samples are taken from the intertidal zone out to a depth of 10 meters (and optionally out to 20 meters depth). These samples are then processed (the organisms are isolated) and then analyzed and catalogued. The information (regarding the kind and number of organisms analyzed) is sent to the global headquarters of NaGISA- the University of Kyoto in Japan. All of this information is then collated on the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS website). The end goal of the larger CoML effort is to find what \"was\", what \"is\", and what \"will be\" in the world's oceans. For NaGISA the goal is to find this in the world's in-shore areas.",

When Two Cities was absorbed into the Rank Organisation in the mid-1940s Coen was employed by Sir David Cunynghame of London Film Productions as a subtitler. As Coen later described it in an interview, he did not know anything about subtitling at the time, and learned on the job: I finally got a phone call from London Films, Sir Cunnyngham, that 's it, who asked me whether I had ever subtitles pictures. I immediately said I had when in point of fact I did not know what he meant, and there was a young man in the office with Sir David Cunnynghame called Lew Watt, and he said Lew Watt will do the technical side and we want you to subtitle an Italian picture in to English. I said certainly . I came out of his office and Lew Watt said to me you don't know what they're talking about do you, I said you're quite right, he said well I'll show you. And I started subtitling pictures with Lew Watt, I used to do the literary side, and he used to do the technical side, the spotting, and lengths, and we together did subtitles for 40 or 50 pictures. The funny thing was we subtitled pictures in Chinese, in Indian and for the Chinese picture I had to have a Chinese waiter with me to tell me where the subtitles [...] I had the Italian dialogue and I had the picture, they gave me a film and we did the spotting together with Lew Watt and the measurements and I used to type the script. We had the film, we had the print which used to run on the two sided thing. And Lew Watt was working all the day so we had to do this at night, so we either used to work at night till 2 o'clock in the morning or we used to work at the weekends. There was always the problem that the Movieola might break down and so we had spare keys of other cutting rooms in in elm St in case we were caught. And that was how we started.Coen later founded his own company Kenilworth Film Productions and spent most of the post-war years producing second features. He made a dozen films in partnership with the director Charles Saunders. He later produced the 1971 horror film \"Burke & Hare\" and the comedies \"Au Pair Girls\" and \"Intimate Games.\"",

Temperate evergreen forests are common in the coastal areas of regions that have mild winters and heavy rainfall, or inland in drier climates or mountain areas.

Temperate forests can be further distinguished by weather patterns and geographical features that favor the predominance of certain kinds of trees. In temperate coniferous forests, evergreen conifers predominate, while in temperate broadleaf and mixed forests, a more even distribution exists between evergreen trees and deciduous trees. Temperate deciduous forests, a subgroup of temperate broadleaf forests, consist of trees that lose their leaves every year. Finally, temperate rainforests typically have heavy rainfall and dense humidity. But in some temperate forests there are just trees with needles and do not shed their leaves during the winter, so the climate is a little different and not as cold.

We then determine which of these forests has a hamlet named 'Oakenclough' on its edge (Node 3). After identifying the correct forest, we look for alternative or historical names for it (Node 4). This structured approach ensures that we accurately trace from the specific geographical location to the required information about the forest's alternative names."

            "Temperate forest\nTemperate forests correspond to forest concentration formed in the northern and southern hemisphere, or in temperate regions. It is the same as a tropical forest except for the climate and some of the animals adaptations. Main characteristics include: wide leaves, large and tall trees, large wild canopy and non seasonal vegetation. Temperate forests can be further distinguished by weather patterns and geographical features that favor the predominance of certain kinds of trees. In temperate coniferous forests, evergreen conifers predominate, while in temperate broadleaf and mixed forests, a more even distribution exists between evergreen trees and deciduous trees. Temperate deciduous forests, a subgroup of temperate broadleaf forests, consist of trees that lose their leaves every year. Finally, temperate rainforests typically have heavy rainfall and dense humidity. But in some temperate forests there are just trees with needles and do not shed their leaves during the winter, so the climate is a little different and not as cold. They are also known as montane forests.",

Temperate evergreen forests are common in the coastal areas of regions that have mild winters and heavy rainfall, or inland in drier climates or mountain areas. Temperate coniferous forests are only found in the Northern Hemisphere in North America, Europe, and Asia. A separate ecoregion, the tropical coniferous forests, occurs in more tropical climates.",
