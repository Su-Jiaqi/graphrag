The siege of Buda was also the shortest siege in the Hungarian Freedom War of 1848-1849 (18 days). The senseless bombardment of Pest by Major General Heinrich Hentzi, the Austrian commander of the city of Pest destroyed the classicist buildings from the shores of the Danube, but the other parts of the capitals also suffered heavy damages because of the artillery duels of the two parts. With the capture of the Buda Castle ended the complete liberation of the Hungarian capital cities (Buda and Pest), and thanks to this the second Hungarian revolutionary Government led by Bertalan Szemere together with Lajos Kossuth, the Governor-President of Hungary returned from Debrecen the interim capital of the Hungarian revolution, in the real capital of Hungary. At 21 May 1849, the same day with the capture of Buda, the two emperors: Franz Joseph I of Austria and tsar Nicholas I of Russia signed the final treaty which decided the involvement of 200 000 Russian soldiers (and a 80 000 strong reserve force, in the case that they were needed) in Hungary, in order to help the Habsburg Empire to crush the Hungarian revolution.",

The siege of Buda was also the shortest siege in the Hungarian Freedom War of 1848-1849 (18 days).

Classical music is art music produced or rooted in the traditions of Western music (both liturgical and secular), and has long been played at festival-like settings.

The major time divisions of classical music are as follows: the early music period, which includes the Medieval (500\u20131400) and the Renaissance (1400\u20131600) era, played at early music festivals; the common practice period, which includes the Baroque (1600\u20131750), Classical (1750\u20131830), and Romantic eras (1804\u20131910), which included opera festivals and choral festivals; and the 20th century (1901\u20132000) which includes the modern (1890\u20131930) that overlaps from the late 19th-century, the high modern (mid 20th-century), and contemporary classical music festivals or postmodern (1975\u20132000) eras, the last of which overlaps into the 21st-century.
