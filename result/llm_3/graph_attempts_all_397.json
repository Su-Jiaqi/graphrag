Later, the hydraulic power generated electricity locally for the same mill factories. These power canals were often filled in as electricity (transported by power lines) replaced the need for local water power, and road transport needs or city expansion needs reclaimed the land. Some hydraulic power canals were transformed into local electric generators, but most were closed.

            "The Los Angeles Aqueduct system, which includes the Owens Valley aqueduct and the Second Los Angeles Aqueduct, was constructed and operated by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. The Owens Valley aqueduct was designed and built by the city's water department, under the supervision of Chief Engineer William Mulholland. The aqueduct system delivers water from the Owens River in the Eastern Sierra Nevada Mountains to Los Angeles, California. It was recognized as a historic civil engineering landmark in 1971.\n\nThe construction of the aqueduct was overseen by Frederick Eaton, who was the political mastermind behind the project, and William Mulholland, who was responsible for building the infrastructure. The aqueduct led to the California Water Wars and the creation of the St. Francis Dam, which was an integral part of the water supply infrastructure.\n\nThe aqueduct also had an impact on the development of the San Fernando Valley, with the town of Owensmouth being founded in 1912 and later joining the city of Los Angeles in 1917, eventually being renamed Canoga Park in 1931.\n\nThe aqueduct system also had environmental impacts, as it extensively diverted Rush Creek in the twentieth century, leading to a lawsuit in 1985 to maintain trout populations in good condition.\n\nOverall, the construction and operational period of the Los Angeles Aqueduct spans from the early 20th century to the present day, with ongoing environmental and historical implications.",

He and his family were interned in Douglas on the Isle of Man during the Second World War. He began his career working for Filippo Del Giudice and Two Cities Films. When Two Cities was absorbed into the Rank Organisation in the mid-1940s Coen was employed by Sir David Cunynghame of London Film Productions as a subtitler. As Coen later described it in an interview, he did not know anything about subtitling at the time, and learned on the job: I finally got a phone call from London Films, Sir Cunnyngham, that 's it, who asked me whether I had ever subtitles pictures. I immediately said I had when in point of fact I did not know what he meant, and there was a young man in the office with Sir David Cunnynghame called Lew Watt, and he said Lew Watt will do the technical side and we want you to subtitle an Italian picture in to English. I said certainly . I came out of his office and Lew Watt said to me you don't know what they're talking about do you, I said you're quite right, he said well I'll show you. And I started subtitling pictures with Lew Watt, I used to do the literary side, and he used to do the technical side, the spotting, and lengths, and we together did subtitles for 40 or 50 pictures. The funny thing was we subtitled pictures in Chinese, in Indian and for the Chinese picture I had to have a Chinese waiter with me to tell me where the subtitles [...] I had the Italian dialogue and I had the picture, they gave me a film and we did the spotting together with Lew Watt and the measurements and I used to type the script. We had the film, we had the print which used to run on the two sided thing. And Lew Watt was working all the day so we had to do this at night, so we either used to work at night till 2 o'clock in the morning or we used to work at the weekends. There was always the problem that the Movieola might break down and so we had spare keys of other cutting rooms in in elm St in case we were caught. And that was how we started.Coen later founded his own company Kenilworth Film Productions and spent most of the post-war years producing second features. He made a dozen films in partnership with the director Charles Saunders. He later produced the 1971 horror film \"Burke & Hare\" and the comedies \"Au Pair Girls\" and \"Intimate Games.\"",
