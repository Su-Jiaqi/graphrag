            "Seoul International Women's Film Festival\nSEOUL International Women\u2019s Film Festival (SIWFF, previously International Women's Film Festival in Seoul, IWFFIS) first took place on April 1, 1997, which marked the second appearance of the international film festival in Korea following Busan International Film Festival launched in 1996. This was the time when there was no clear idea about how to define a film festival. At that time, SEOUL International Women\u2019s Film Festival came up with a catchphrase See the world through women\u2019s eyes, setting its main goal to introduce women\u2019s films that explore the \u201cwomen\u2019s reality from the women\u2019s perspectives\u201d. Featuring films by women, for women, and of women, the 1st edition of SEOUL International Film Festival received a number of positive reviews from the audience, which was never anticipated this much. Thanks to continuous support from the audience, SEOUL International Film Festival that used to be happening every other year has become an annual event since the 3rd edition in 2001. For the 6th edition in 2004, SEOUL International Women\u2019s Film Festival looked for changes by relocating the festival office and venues to Sinchon, the street of youth and culture. For the 9th edition in 2007, the Queer Rainbow section was first introduced, presenting films about life and culture of gender minorities. In order to go beyond the gender boundaries based on biological sex and to reach out for solidarity, SEOUL International Women\u2019s Film Festival newly created the Open Cinema section encompassing feminist films made by male directors. Now in 2015, SEOUL International Film Festival attempts to build its new festival identity and become a cultural platform more approachable for a wide variety of audiences by changing the official English title of the festival from International Women\u2019s Film Festival in Seoul to SEOUL International Women\u2019s Film Festival as well as by retouching the festival logo used for last 17 years.",

(Compare Peter Pan's flight power, which is also powered by happy thoughts.) Conversely, thinking of something sad literally brings Albert and his visitors \"down to earth\" again.

            "Postpipe\nIn archaeology, a postpipe (or post pipe) is the remains of an upright timber placed in a posthole. Given the right conditions, timbers may survive over long periods of time and a recovered postpipe can simply be of solid wood. Under less preservative conditions however, only a dark circular stain of organic material may be left in the fill of the posthole observable in plan and section. This differs in consistency from the less organic backfill of the posthole and can be identified simply through this change in make-up. The size and depth and of the postpipe can provide information as to any reuse of the posthole especially if several different postpipes can be identified. They can also indicate the species of wood used and help suggest the nature of the structure that the timber once supported. The term was first used by Maud Cunnington when she excavated the site of Woodhenge in the English county of Wiltshire during the 1920s and found numerous examples of decomposed timber posts.",
