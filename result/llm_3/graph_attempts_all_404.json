Prior to 1910, the only county jail was in Genoa, the county seat; however, since Gardnerville was several miles from Genoa, it resorted to housing prisoners in the local judge's granary. As the granary was considered unfit for holding prisoners, the community petitioned the county to construct a new jail. However, local leaders in Minden, who wanted to move the county seat to their town, protested the move, as they suspected that Gardnerville was attempting to claim the county seat itself. Nonetheless, the county approved the construction of the new jail. The jail housed its first prisoners before construction even finished, as the Genoa jail burned down; one prisoner was briefly chained to a post until the new jail could accommodate him. Once completed, the jail served the county until 1915, when Minden became the county seat and opened its own county jail.",

The supervisors from Des Moines and Lee counties met on September 7, 1887 to view the location of a new bridge between the two counties over the Skunk River on the Burlington-Fort Madison Road. Financing delayed building the new bridge. They determined that Des Moines County would pay three-fifths of the costs and Lee County the remainder. Chicago engineer Horace B. Horton designed the Pratt truss, and it was built by the James B. Diver Bridge Company of Keokuk, Iowa. The Walker's Ferry Bridge was originally a two-span structure, and it was completed for $9,435. It was replaced with another bridge in 1930, and one of the spans was relocated to this location. Known locally as the Eisenhower Bridge, it replaced an 1895 span that was washed out in a flood. While it lost some of its historical integrity, it remains an example of early wagon bridge construction. It is also one of the few iron truss bridges remaining in Iowa, and it was designed by a prominent bridge engineer. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.",

The first bridge at this location was washed away in a flood while it was under construction in 1858. The second bridge was completed in 1864, and it was destroyed in a flood two years later. A temporary bridge was completed in 1867, and it was replaced by a truss bridge in 1870. It was used for 40 years despite an engineer's study in 1892 that suggested it be condemned. The Floyd County Board of Supervisors approved a replacement bridge in 1908. The old bridge was moved to a new spot five blocks downstream, but contract problems delayed construction of the new bridge. Advance Construction Company of Waukesha, Wisconsin was finally awarded a contract in March 1909. The three span concrete filled spandrel arch bridge was designed by their designing engineer G.W. Miller. It was completed in 1910 for about $40,000, which was paid for by the county and the city. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999.",

Built of weatherboarded walls with stone abutments and a metal roof, the bridge features vertical siding, and its portals have remained vertical and resisted creeping into another shape. The heart of the bridge's structure employs the Burr Truss design, which mixes the king post truss with a wooden arch designed by Andrea Palladio in the sixteenth century. Shinn built his bridge to span the western branch of Wolf Creek in Palmer Township. Measuring 98 ft in length, the bridge was constructed soon after the drowning of one of Shinn's children.",

            "Postpipe\nIn archaeology, a postpipe (or post pipe) is the remains of an upright timber placed in a posthole. Given the right conditions, timbers may survive over long periods of time and a recovered postpipe can simply be of solid wood. Under less preservative conditions however, only a dark circular stain of organic material may be left in the fill of the posthole observable in plan and section. This differs in consistency from the less organic backfill of the posthole and can be identified simply through this change in make-up. The size and depth and of the postpipe can provide information as to any reuse of the posthole especially if several different postpipes can be identified. They can also indicate the species of wood used and help suggest the nature of the structure that the timber once supported. The term was first used by Maud Cunnington when she excavated the site of Woodhenge in the English county of Wiltshire during the 1920s and found numerous examples of decomposed timber posts.",
            "Sharon Gannon\nSharon Gannon (born July 4, 1951 in Washington, D.C.) is a yoga teacher, animal rights advocate, musician, author, dancer/choreographer and painter. Along with David Life, she is the co-founder of the Jivamukti Yoga Method which contributed to the exponential rise in popularity of yoga in the west during the late 20th century. The Jivamukti Yoga Method distinguishes itself as a path to enlightenment by promoting compassion for all beings, challenging the modern belief that enslaving and exploiting animals and the natural world is our right as the dominant species. The Jivamukti Yoga Method teaches its students that they must be willing to promote the happiness of all beings without exception if they wish to realize their fullest capacity for joy. Jivamukti students are encouraged to adopt a diet that eliminates all animal products (vegan) as this is the diet that causes the least amount of harm to the earth and other beings, humans included. Core to the teachings of Jivamukti Yoga is the concept of shunyata or (emptiness) which is found in the ancient yogic scriptures. This idea can be simply stated as: everything you see and experience in the world comes from your perception of it. If you want to change someone or to change the world, you start by changing yourself by changing your views. When you begin to embrace this concept and put it into practice then you cannot find solace in complaining or blaming others. You are freed from seeing yourself as a victim of others or of circumstances. According to Gannon: \"How you treat others will determine how others treat you. How others treat you will determine how you see yourself. How you see yourself will determine who you are.\"",

It is concerned with independently supervising and monitoring the quality of asset management accounts with the aim of ensuring performance and quality in order to provide the required benefit for the asset management client. Dependent on setup, investment controlling not only encompasses controlling activities but also can include areas from compliance to performance review. Investment controlling aspects can also be taken into consideration by asset management clients or investment advisers/consultants and consequently it is likely that these stakeholders also run certain investment controlling activities."

Horton designed the Pratt truss, and it was built by the James B. Diver Bridge Company of Keokuk, Iowa. The Walker's Ferry Bridge was originally a two-span structure, and it was completed for $9,435. It was replaced with another bridge in 1930, and one of the spans was relocated to this location. Known locally as the Eisenhower Bridge, it replaced an 1895 span that was washed out in a flood. While it lost some of its historical integrity, it remains an example of early wagon bridge construction. It is also one of the few iron truss bridges remaining in Iowa, and it was designed by a prominent bridge engineer. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.",

The bridge was built in 1889 to a design by Charles A. Allen, at the time a civil engineer for the city of Worcester. The bridge was built to replace an older wooden span at the request of Edwin Bartlett, the owner of textile mills in North Oxford, whose businesses and employees would have used the road. The bridge is 30 ft long and 42 ft wide, with its elliptical arch reaching a height of 13 ft above the river. The facing of the bridge is rough-cut granite that has been fixed with mortar. In contrast, the granite stones that make up the arch have been very precisely worked. The bridge has parapet walls made of large granite slabs 4.5 ft , 2 ft wide, and 1 ft thick.",

Before a bridge was built at this location local citizens would cross the river by way of a ferry, at a ford in summer, and across the ice in winter. The first bridge at this location was washed away in a flood while it was under construction in 1858. The second bridge was completed in 1864, and it was destroyed in a flood two years later. A temporary bridge was completed in 1867, and it was replaced by a truss bridge in 1870. It was used for 40 years despite an engineer's study in 1892 that suggested it be condemned. The Floyd County Board of Supervisors approved a replacement bridge in 1908. The old bridge was moved to a new spot five blocks downstream, but contract problems delayed construction of the new bridge. Advance Construction Company of Waukesha, Wisconsin was finally awarded a contract in March 1909. The three span concrete filled spandrel arch bridge was designed by their designing engineer G.W. Miller. It was completed in 1910 for about $40,000, which was paid for by the county and the city. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999.",

A Parker truss bridge, it was built in 1897 and 1898 at a cost of approximately $12,000. J.R. Sheely was the engineer for the original Sutliff Bridge. After a modern replacement was built over the Cedar in 1983, the bridge was slated for destruction, but it was ultimately saved, and on May 15, 1998, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Although the bridge remained a celebrated location for locals and for visitors from across Iowa, including a 5k foot race beloved as the \u201cworst road race in America\", it succumbed to massive floods in the second week of June 2008: while the river normally flowed many feet below the bottom of the bridge, the floods topped the bridge's deck, and one of the bridge's spans was washed away on June 13 as the surrounding countryside was inundated with vast amounts of water. It is estimated that restoring the bridge will cost $1.7 million. Most of this money would come from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), with the rest coming from donations and local governments; both FEMA and the Johnson County Board of Supervisors have agreed in principle to repair the bridge.

When Two Cities was absorbed into the Rank Organisation in the mid-1940s Coen was employed by Sir David Cunynghame of London Film Productions as a subtitler. As Coen later described it in an interview, he did not know anything about subtitling at the time, and learned on the job: I finally got a phone call from London Films, Sir Cunnyngham, that 's it, who asked me whether I had ever subtitles pictures. I immediately said I had when in point of fact I did not know what he meant, and there was a young man in the office with Sir David Cunnynghame called Lew Watt, and he said Lew Watt will do the technical side and we want you to subtitle an Italian picture in to English. I said certainly . I came out of his office and Lew Watt said to me you don't know what they're talking about do you, I said you're quite right, he said well I'll show you. And I started subtitling pictures with Lew Watt, I used to do the literary side, and he used to do the technical side, the spotting, and lengths, and we together did subtitles for 40 or 50 pictures. The funny thing was we subtitled pictures in Chinese, in Indian and for the Chinese picture I had to have a Chinese waiter with me to tell me where the subtitles [...] I had the Italian dialogue and I had the picture, they gave me a film and we did the spotting together with Lew Watt and the measurements and I used to type the script. We had the film, we had the print which used to run on the two sided thing.

            "NaGISA\nNaGISA (Natural Geography in Shore Areas or Natural Geography of In-Shore Areas) is an international collaborative effort aimed at inventorying, cataloguing, and monitoring biodiversity of the in-shore area. So named for the Japanese word \"nagisa\" (\"where the land meets the sea\"), it is an Apronym. NaGISA is the first project of the larger CoML effort (Census of Marine Life) to have global participation in actual field work. The actual procedures of this project involve inexpensive collection equipment (for easy universal participation). This equipment is used to photograph sampling sites, to actually take samples from the sites, and to process these samples. At each site throughout the world, samples are taken from the intertidal zone out to a depth of 10 meters (and optionally out to 20 meters depth). These samples are then processed (the organisms are isolated) and then analyzed and catalogued. The information (regarding the kind and number of organisms analyzed) is sent to the global headquarters of NaGISA- the University of Kyoto in Japan. All of this information is then collated on the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS website). The end goal of the larger CoML effort is to find what \"was\", what \"is\", and what \"will be\" in the world's oceans. For NaGISA the goal is to find this in the world's in-shore areas.",
            "White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan\nThe White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan are considered the most militant as well as the most violent chapter of the Ku Klux Klan in history. They originated in Mississippi in the early 1960s under the leadership of Samuel Bowers, its first Grand Wizard. The White Knights of Mississippi were formed in 1964, and they included roughly 200 members of the Original Knights of Louisiana. The White Knights were not interested in holding public demonstrations or in letting any information about themselves get out to the masses. Similar to the United Klans of America (UKA), the White Knights of Mississippi were very secretive about their group. Within a year, their membership was up to around six thousand, and they had Klaverns in over half of the counties in Mississippi. But by 1967, the number of active members had shrunk to around four hundred.",

            "Bartlett's Bridge\nBartlett's Bridge is a historic stone arch bridge carrying Clara Barton Road over the French River in Oxford, Massachusetts. The bridge was built in 1889 to a design by Charles A. Allen, at the time a civil engineer for the city of Worcester. The bridge was built to replace an older wooden span at the request of Edwin Bartlett, the owner of textile mills in North Oxford, whose businesses and employees would have used the road. The bridge is 30 ft long and 42 ft wide, with its elliptical arch reaching a height of 13 ft above the river. The facing of the bridge is rough-cut granite that has been fixed with mortar. In contrast, the granite stones that make up the arch have been very precisely worked. The bridge has parapet walls made of large granite slabs 4.5 ft , 2 ft wide, and 1 ft thick.",

            "Sutliff Bridge\nThe Sutliff Bridge is a bridge over the Cedar River at Sutliff, a Johnson County community near Lisbon, Iowa, United States. A Parker truss bridge, it was built in 1897 and 1898 at a cost of approximately $12,000. J.R. Sheely was the engineer for the original Sutliff Bridge. After a modern replacement was built over the Cedar in 1983, the bridge was slated for destruction, but it was ultimately saved, and on May 15, 1998, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Although the bridge remained a celebrated location for locals and for visitors from across Iowa, including a 5k foot race beloved as the \u201cworst road race in America\", it succumbed to massive floods in the second week of June 2008: while the river normally flowed many feet below the bottom of the bridge, the floods topped the bridge's deck, and one of the bridge's spans was washed away on June 13 as the surrounding countryside was inundated with vast amounts of water. It is estimated that restoring the bridge will cost $1.7 million. Most of this money would come from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), with the rest coming from donations and local governments; both FEMA and the Johnson County Board of Supervisors have agreed in principle to repair the bridge. The bridge reconstruction was supervised by VJ Engineering of Coralville, Iowa and construction was completed by Iowa Bridge and Culvert of Washington, Iowa. In October 2012 a ribbon cutting ceremony was held opening the bridge to public use for the first time in four years.",
            "Shinn Covered Bridge\nThe Shinn Covered Bridge is a historic wooden covered bridge in the southeastern part of the U.S. state of Ohio. Located in the countryside northeast of Bartlett in Washington County, this single-span truss bridge was built in 1886 by local carpenter Charles T. Shinn. Built of weatherboarded walls with stone abutments and a metal roof, the bridge features vertical siding, and its portals have remained vertical and resisted creeping into another shape. The heart of the bridge's structure employs the Burr Truss design, which mixes the king post truss with a wooden arch designed by Andrea Palladio in the sixteenth century. Shinn built his bridge to span the western branch of Wolf Creek in Palmer Township. Measuring 98 ft in length, the bridge was constructed soon after the drowning of one of Shinn's children.",

The supervisors from Des Moines and Lee counties met on September 7, 1887 to view the location of a new bridge between the two counties over the Skunk River on the Burlington-Fort Madison Road. Financing delayed building the new bridge. They determined that Des Moines County would pay three-fifths of the costs and Lee County the remainder. Chicago engineer Horace B. Horton designed the Pratt truss, and it was built by the James B. Diver Bridge Company of Keokuk, Iowa. The Walker's Ferry Bridge was originally a two-span structure, and it was completed for $9,435. It was replaced with another bridge in 1930, and one of the spans was relocated to this location. Known locally as the Eisenhower Bridge, it replaced an 1895 span that was washed out in a flood. While it lost some of its historical integrity, it remains an example of early wagon bridge construction. It is also one of the few iron truss bridges remaining in Iowa, and it was designed by a prominent bridge engineer. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.",
            "Main Street Bridge (Charles City, Iowa)\nThe Main Street Bridge is a historic structure located in Charles City, Iowa, United States. It spans the Cedar River for 248 ft . Before a bridge was built at this location local citizens would cross the river by way of a ferry, at a ford in summer, and across the ice in winter. The first bridge at this location was washed away in a flood while it was under construction in 1858. The second bridge was completed in 1864, and it was destroyed in a flood two years later. A temporary bridge was completed in 1867, and it was replaced by a truss bridge in 1870. It was used for 40 years despite an engineer's study in 1892 that suggested it be condemned. The Floyd County Board of Supervisors approved a replacement bridge in 1908. The old bridge was moved to a new spot five blocks downstream, but contract problems delayed construction of the new bridge. Advance Construction Company of Waukesha, Wisconsin was finally awarded a contract in March 1909. The three span concrete filled spandrel arch bridge was designed by their designing engineer G.W. Miller. It was completed in 1910 for about $40,000, which was paid for by the county and the city. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999.",

A temporary bridge was completed in 1867, and it was replaced by a truss bridge in 1870. It was used for 40 years despite an engineer's study in 1892 that suggested it be condemned. The Floyd County Board of Supervisors approved a replacement bridge in 1908. The old bridge was moved to a new spot five blocks downstream, but contract problems delayed construction of the new bridge. Advance Construction Company of Waukesha, Wisconsin was finally awarded a contract in March 1909. The three span concrete filled spandrel arch bridge was designed by their designing engineer G.W.

Prior to 1910, the only county jail was in Genoa, the county seat; however, since Gardnerville was several miles from Genoa, it resorted to housing prisoners in the local judge's granary. As the granary was considered unfit for holding prisoners, the community petitioned the county to construct a new jail. However, local leaders in Minden, who wanted to move the county seat to their town, protested the move, as they suspected that Gardnerville was attempting to claim the county seat itself. Nonetheless, the county approved the construction of the new jail. The jail housed its first prisoners before construction even finished, as the Genoa jail burned down; one prisoner was briefly chained to a post until the new jail could accommodate him. Once completed, the jail served the county until 1915, when Minden became the county seat and opened its own county jail.",

After a modern replacement was built over the Cedar in 1983, the bridge was slated for destruction, but it was ultimately saved, and on May 15, 1998, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Although the bridge remained a celebrated location for locals and for visitors from across Iowa, including a 5k foot race beloved as the \u201cworst road race in America\", it succumbed to massive floods in the second week of June 2008: while the river normally flowed many feet below the bottom of the bridge, the floods topped the bridge's deck, and one of the bridge's spans was washed away on June 13 as the surrounding countryside was inundated with vast amounts of water. It is estimated that restoring the bridge will cost $1.7 million. Most of this money would come from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), with the rest coming from donations and local governments; both FEMA and the Johnson County Board of Supervisors have agreed in principle to repair the bridge. The bridge reconstruction was supervised by VJ Engineering of Coralville, Iowa and construction was completed by Iowa Bridge and Culvert of Washington, Iowa.

The jail was built in 1910 and served as Douglas County's only jail from 1910 to 1915. Prior to 1910, the only county jail was in Genoa, the county seat; however, since Gardnerville was several miles from Genoa, it resorted to housing prisoners in the local judge's granary. As the granary was considered unfit for holding prisoners, the community petitioned the county to construct a new jail. However, local leaders in Minden, who wanted to move the county seat to their town, protested the move, as they suspected that Gardnerville was attempting to claim the county seat itself. Nonetheless, the county approved the construction of the new jail. The jail housed its first prisoners before construction even finished, as the Genoa jail burned down; one prisoner was briefly chained to a post until the new jail could accommodate him. Once completed, the jail served the county until 1915, when Minden became the county seat and opened its own county jail.",

He and his family were interned in Douglas on the Isle of Man during the Second World War. He began his career working for Filippo Del Giudice and Two Cities Films. When Two Cities was absorbed into the Rank Organisation in the mid-1940s Coen was employed by Sir David Cunynghame of London Film Productions as a subtitler. As Coen later described it in an interview, he did not know anything about subtitling at the time, and learned on the job: I finally got a phone call from London Films, Sir Cunnyngham, that 's it, who asked me whether I had ever subtitles pictures. I immediately said I had when in point of fact I did not know what he meant, and there was a young man in the office with Sir David Cunnynghame called Lew Watt, and he said Lew Watt will do the technical side and we want you to subtitle an Italian picture in to English. I said certainly . I came out of his office and Lew Watt said to me you don't know what they're talking about do you, I said you're quite right, he said well I'll show you. And I started subtitling pictures with Lew Watt, I used to do the literary side, and he used to do the technical side, the spotting, and lengths, and we together did subtitles for 40 or 50 pictures. The funny thing was we subtitled pictures in Chinese, in Indian and for the Chinese picture I had to have a Chinese waiter with me to tell me where the subtitles [...] I had the Italian dialogue and I had the picture, they gave me a film and we did the spotting together with Lew Watt and the measurements and I used to type the script. We had the film, we had the print which used to run on the two sided thing. And Lew Watt was working all the day so we had to do this at night, so we either used to work at night till 2 o'clock in the morning or we used to work at the weekends. There was always the problem that the Movieola might break down and so we had spare keys of other cutting rooms in in elm St in case we were caught. And that was how we started.Coen later founded his own company Kenilworth Film Productions and spent most of the post-war years producing second features. He made a dozen films in partnership with the director Charles Saunders. He later produced the 1971 horror film \"Burke & Hare\" and the comedies \"Au Pair Girls\" and \"Intimate Games.\"",
            "Memory of Mankind\nSeveral motivations underlie the project. The primary ambition of MOM is to preserve an image of our era, created by numerous participants all over the planet. MOM will also contain information which our society is obliged to forward to the future: e.g. description of nuclear waste repositories. MOM collaborates with the NEA and SKB. Although the most obvious ambition and often described in the media is the concern about preserving our knowledge, this is not the primary goal of MOM. Serving as a time capsule MOM is both: in a time frame of millennia it is the story about us, and in a time frame of decades it is a backup. In times where global warming, nuclear danger and biological warfare threaten the existence of civilization, saving the core knowledge and culture acquired over centuries is a backup measure. In case of a collapse, the MOM project could help survivors to rebuild civilization. Linked to this, an another reason is of political order: facing the lack of reactivity of authorities concerning global warming, the MOM project is a reminder of what can happen. Roman and Greek civilizations whose histories have been reconstructed by the small percentage of texts and artifacts which survived until our days are examples that have inspired the MOM project. Finally, it's a critic of our digital civilization : according to Kunze, maybe nothing of the 21st century will last in the future, since most of our interactions are now virtual. The \"accuracy versus bullshit\" is one of the main themes of the MOM project, worried about loss of information, the project can only aim to save a fragment of the information produced until today, but this fragment has to be representative.",

NaGISA is the first project of the larger CoML effort (Census of Marine Life) to have global participation in actual field work. The actual procedures of this project involve inexpensive collection equipment (for easy universal participation). This equipment is used to photograph sampling sites, to actually take samples from the sites, and to process these samples. At each site throughout the world, samples are taken from the intertidal zone out to a depth of 10 meters (and optionally out to 20 meters depth). These samples are then processed (the organisms are isolated) and then analyzed and catalogued. The information (regarding the kind and number of organisms analyzed) is sent to the global headquarters of NaGISA- the University of Kyoto in Japan. All of this information is then collated on the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS website). The end goal of the larger CoML effort is to find what \"was\", what \"is\", and what \"will be\" in the world's oceans. For NaGISA the goal is to find this in the world's in-shore areas.",

Located in the countryside northeast of Bartlett in Washington County, this single-span truss bridge was built in 1886 by local carpenter Charles T. Shinn. Built of weatherboarded walls with stone abutments and a metal roof, the bridge features vertical siding, and its portals have remained vertical and resisted creeping into another shape. The heart of the bridge's structure employs the Burr Truss design, which mixes the king post truss with a wooden arch designed by Andrea Palladio in the sixteenth century. Shinn built his bridge to span the western branch of Wolf Creek in Palmer Township. Measuring 98 ft in length, the bridge was constructed soon after the drowning of one of Shinn's children.",

            "Postpipe\nIn archaeology, a postpipe (or post pipe) is the remains of an upright timber placed in a posthole. Given the right conditions, timbers may survive over long periods of time and a recovered postpipe can simply be of solid wood. Under less preservative conditions however, only a dark circular stain of organic material may be left in the fill of the posthole observable in plan and section. This differs in consistency from the less organic backfill of the posthole and can be identified simply through this change in make-up. The size and depth and of the postpipe can provide information as to any reuse of the posthole especially if several different postpipes can be identified. They can also indicate the species of wood used and help suggest the nature of the structure that the timber once supported. The term was first used by Maud Cunnington when she excavated the site of Woodhenge in the English county of Wiltshire during the 1920s and found numerous examples of decomposed timber posts.",
            "Sharon Gannon\nSharon Gannon (born July 4, 1951 in Washington, D.C.) is a yoga teacher, animal rights advocate, musician, author, dancer/choreographer and painter. Along with David Life, she is the co-founder of the Jivamukti Yoga Method which contributed to the exponential rise in popularity of yoga in the west during the late 20th century. The Jivamukti Yoga Method distinguishes itself as a path to enlightenment by promoting compassion for all beings, challenging the modern belief that enslaving and exploiting animals and the natural world is our right as the dominant species. The Jivamukti Yoga Method teaches its students that they must be willing to promote the happiness of all beings without exception if they wish to realize their fullest capacity for joy. Jivamukti students are encouraged to adopt a diet that eliminates all animal products (vegan) as this is the diet that causes the least amount of harm to the earth and other beings, humans included. Core to the teachings of Jivamukti Yoga is the concept of shunyata or (emptiness) which is found in the ancient yogic scriptures. This idea can be simply stated as: everything you see and experience in the world comes from your perception of it. If you want to change someone or to change the world, you start by changing yourself by changing your views. When you begin to embrace this concept and put it into practice then you cannot find solace in complaining or blaming others. You are freed from seeing yourself as a victim of others or of circumstances. According to Gannon: \"How you treat others will determine how others treat you. How others treat you will determine how you see yourself. How you see yourself will determine who you are.\"",

After a modern replacement was built over the Cedar in 1983, the bridge was slated for destruction, but it was ultimately saved, and on May 15, 1998, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Although the bridge remained a celebrated location for locals and for visitors from across Iowa, including a 5k foot race beloved as the \u201cworst road race in America\", it succumbed to massive floods in the second week of June 2008: while the river normally flowed many feet below the bottom of the bridge, the floods topped the bridge's deck, and one of the bridge's spans was washed away on June 13 as the surrounding countryside was inundated with vast amounts of water. It is estimated that restoring the bridge will cost $1.7 million. Most of this money would come from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), with the rest coming from donations and local governments; both FEMA and the Johnson County Board of Supervisors have agreed in principle to repair the bridge.

Before a bridge was built at this location local citizens would cross the river by way of a ferry, at a ford in summer, and across the ice in winter. The first bridge at this location was washed away in a flood while it was under construction in 1858. The second bridge was completed in 1864, and it was destroyed in a flood two years later. A temporary bridge was completed in 1867, and it was replaced by a truss bridge in 1870. It was used for 40 years despite an engineer's study in 1892 that suggested it be condemned. The Floyd County Board of Supervisors approved a replacement bridge in 1908. The old bridge was moved to a new spot five blocks downstream, but contract problems delayed construction of the new bridge.

Built of weatherboarded walls with stone abutments and a metal roof, the bridge features vertical siding, and its portals have remained vertical and resisted creeping into another shape. The heart of the bridge's structure employs the Burr Truss design, which mixes the king post truss with a wooden arch designed by Andrea Palladio in the sixteenth century. Shinn built his bridge to span the western branch of Wolf Creek in Palmer Township. Measuring 98 ft in length, the bridge was constructed soon after the drowning of one of Shinn's children.",

Before a bridge was built at this location local citizens would cross the river by way of a ferry, at a ford in summer, and across the ice in winter. The first bridge at this location was washed away in a flood while it was under construction in 1858. The second bridge was completed in 1864, and it was destroyed in a flood two years later. A temporary bridge was completed in 1867, and it was replaced by a truss bridge in 1870. It was used for 40 years despite an engineer's study in 1892 that suggested it be condemned. The Floyd County Board of Supervisors approved a replacement bridge in 1908. The old bridge was moved to a new spot five blocks downstream, but contract problems delayed construction of the new bridge. Advance Construction Company of Waukesha, Wisconsin was finally awarded a contract in March 1909. The three span concrete filled spandrel arch bridge was designed by their designing engineer G.W.

It is estimated that restoring the bridge will cost $1.7 million. Most of this money would come from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), with the rest coming from donations and local governments; both FEMA and the Johnson County Board of Supervisors have agreed in principle to repair the bridge.

The first bridge at this location was washed away in a flood while it was under construction in 1858. The second bridge was completed in 1864, and it was destroyed in a flood two years later. A temporary bridge was completed in 1867, and it was replaced by a truss bridge in 1870. It was used for 40 years despite an engineer's study in 1892 that suggested it be condemned. The Floyd County Board of Supervisors approved a replacement bridge in 1908. The old bridge was moved to a new spot five blocks downstream, but contract problems delayed construction of the new bridge. Advance Construction Company of Waukesha, Wisconsin was finally awarded a contract in March 1909. The three span concrete filled spandrel arch bridge was designed by their designing engineer G.W. Miller. It was completed in 1910 for about $40,000, which was paid for by the county and the city. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999.",

Waukon built its own courthouse in the meantime, but it failed to win back the county seat in yet another vote in 1864. The county sheriff, a Waukon resident, attempted to seize the county's records from the Lansing courthouse in 1866; however, a posse from Lansing stopped him before he could return to Waukon.

            "Eisenhower Bridge (Milton, Iowa)\nThe Eisenhower Bridge is located east of Milton, Iowa, United States. It carries traffic on 252nd Street over the Fox River for 197 ft . The supervisors from Des Moines and Lee counties met on September 7, 1887 to view the location of a new bridge between the two counties over the Skunk River on the Burlington-Fort Madison Road. Financing delayed building the new bridge. They determined that Des Moines County would pay three-fifths of the costs and Lee County the remainder. Chicago engineer Horace B. Horton designed the Pratt truss, and it was built by the James B. Diver Bridge Company of Keokuk, Iowa. The Walker's Ferry Bridge was originally a two-span structure, and it was completed for $9,435. It was replaced with another bridge in 1930, and one of the spans was relocated to this location. Known locally as the Eisenhower Bridge, it replaced an 1895 span that was washed out in a flood. While it lost some of its historical integrity, it remains an example of early wagon bridge construction. It is also one of the few iron truss bridges remaining in Iowa, and it was designed by a prominent bridge engineer. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.",

            "Sutliff Bridge\nThe Sutliff Bridge is a bridge over the Cedar River at Sutliff, a Johnson County community near Lisbon, Iowa, United States. A Parker truss bridge, it was built in 1897 and 1898 at a cost of approximately $12,000. J.R. Sheely was the engineer for the original Sutliff Bridge. After a modern replacement was built over the Cedar in 1983, the bridge was slated for destruction, but it was ultimately saved, and on May 15, 1998, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Although the bridge remained a celebrated location for locals and for visitors from across Iowa, including a 5k foot race beloved as the \u201cworst road race in America\", it succumbed to massive floods in the second week of June 2008: while the river normally flowed many feet below the bottom of the bridge, the floods topped the bridge's deck, and one of the bridge's spans was washed away on June 13 as the surrounding countryside was inundated with vast amounts of water. It is estimated that restoring the bridge will cost $1.7 million. Most of this money would come from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), with the rest coming from donations and local governments; both FEMA and the Johnson County Board of Supervisors have agreed in principle to repair the bridge. The bridge reconstruction was supervised by VJ Engineering of Coralville, Iowa and construction was completed by Iowa Bridge and Culvert of Washington, Iowa. In October 2012 a ribbon cutting ceremony was held opening the bridge to public use for the first time in four years.",
