The season started well before taking a turn for the worse when the club was placed into administration at the end of January 2010, culminating in manager Neil Warnock leaving his job just over a month later and being replaced by Paul Hart, whose tenure saw the club survive relegation on the final day of the season.",

The previous season had seen Palace finish one place above the relegation zone, having been deducted ten points for going into administration. The CPFC 2010 consortium completed a takeover of the club in the close season and installed former Scotland manager George Burley as the club's new boss, with club legend Dougie Freedman continuing his role as assistant manager. However, after a poor start to the season, Burley was sacked on New Year's Day and Freedman named manager the following week. Under Freedman fortunes improved, and the club secured another season at Championship level shortly before the conclusion of the campaign."
