The recording project was initiated by Glass himself who asked collaborator and producer Kurt Munkacsi to present pieces that Glass had composed for larger music ensembles as a song recital for small ensemble. The recital album includes songs Glass had composed with or for singers Leonard Cohen (Book of Longing), Natalie Merchant, Mick Jagger and poet Allen Ginsberg. The album also includes new arrangements by Trevor Gureckis of Glass instrumental music set to new lyrics written by Tara Hugo.",
            "Bombay the Hard Way: Guns, Cars and Sitars\nBombay the Hard Way: Guns, Cars and Sitars is a 1998 project of producer Dan the Automator in which music from 1970s funk Bollywood composer duo Kalyanji-Anandji (Kalyanji Virji Shah and Anandji Virji Shah) was taken and given a funky remix. The album was eventually withdrawn (possibly due to copyright concerns). A sequel, \"Bombay 2: Electric Vindaloo\", was also produced."
