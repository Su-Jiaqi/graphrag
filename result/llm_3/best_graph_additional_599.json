It has two chairlifts and one surface lift: a GMD Mueller doublechair, a Leitner-Poma triplechair, and a Doppelmayr T-bar. The ski area has 30 designated groomed runs and the resort also has many different tree trails and some glades. Despite the smaller size of the resort, which is considerably smaller than neighbouring resorts such as Big White Ski Resort and Silver Star Mountain Resort, the mountain is of good size and is a popular destination for both experienced and first-time skiers, snowboarders and snowshoers. Despite the lower elevation, the resort receives heavy snowfall each year with many powder days throughout the winter season. It was long known as Last Mountain Ski Resort but has since changed its name to Crystal Mountain Resort in 1992. Crystal Mountain Resort offers lessons for skiing and snowboarding as well as offering rentals for snowshoeing. It has not been in operation since 2014 due to a lift malfunction of the Blue doublechair.",
