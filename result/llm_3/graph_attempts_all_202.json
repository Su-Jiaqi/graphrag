            "Muck (gambling)\nMuck in gambling has multiple meanings. In poker, it most often refers to the pile of discarded cards into which players may throw their folded hands, and into which the dealer may place burned cards. It may also refer to the action of throwing a hand into the muck. When a player is folding his hand (face down) without saying anything, in fact the hand is not folded until it reaches the muck (it can be taken back and used if the dealer did not take the hand yet). The practice of mucking cards when discarding helps to ensure that no other player can reliably determine which cards were in the folded hand. In poker, the term may also refer to the action that a player who has not folded may take; he can have his hand \"mucked\" if another player attempts to discard but one or more cards end up in the live players hand. This is why many players will place a chip or other object on their cards: it helps to prevent errant cards from entering their hand. Sometimes they are referred to as card covers, card guards or card protector.",
            "Anything's Wild\nAnything's Wild is a video poker game that allows the player to select any card (by rank) to act as the \"wild card\". The game is a variation of Deuces Wild and is based on five card draw where the player is dealt a five card hand. The player can then choose which cards to keep or discard and is dealt new cards accordingly. The payoff is based on the value of the hand. The \"wild card\" is announced before the hand is dealt and can be substituted for any card in the deck according to what is most beneficial to the player's hand. Since the game uses a standard deck, there are always four \"wild cards\" in play. This allows the player greater flexibility in building a winning hand.",
            "Texas hold 'em\nTexas hold 'em (also known as Texas holdem, hold 'em, and holdem) is a variation of the card game of poker. Two cards, known as the hole cards, are dealt face down to each player, and then five community cards are dealt face up in three stages. The stages consist of a series of three cards (\"the flop\"), later an additional single card (\"the turn\" or \"fourth street\"), and a final card (\"the river\" or \"fifth street\"). Each player seeks the best five card poker hand from any combination of the seven cards of the five community cards and their own two hole cards. (If a player's best five-card poker hand consists only of the five community cards and none of the player's hole cards, it is called \"playing the board\". If you play the board on the river, then you can do no better than tie the other player(s) in the game if no player can make a better hand than the board represents, using either or both hole cards.) Players have betting options to check, call, raise, or fold. Rounds of betting take place before the flop is dealt and after each subsequent deal.",
            "Community card poker\nCommunity card poker refers to any game of poker that uses community cards (also called \"shared cards\" or \"window cards\"), which are cards dealt face up in the center of the table and shared by all players. In these games, each player is dealt privately an incomplete hand (\"hole cards\"), which are then combined with the community cards to make a complete hand. The set of community cards is called the \"board\", and may be dealt in a simple line or arranged in a special pattern. Rules of each game determine how they may be combined with each player's private hand. The most popular community card game today is Texas hold 'em, originating sometime in the 1920s.",
            "Asia Poker\nAsia Poker is a casino table game similar to Pai gow poker that is now popular in most Atlantic City, New Jersey casinos. Players are dealt seven cards and divide their cards into three hands: a four-card hand (High), a two-card hand (Medium) and a one-card hand (Low). The four-card hand must be equal or greater in poker ranking than the two-card hand and the two-card hand must be equal or greater than the one-card hand. After all players have set their hand, the dealer sets the house's hand according to the \"house way\" and then compares each player's hand to the house's hand. If the house wins at least two out of three hands, the player loses. If the player wins at least two or out of three hands the player wins. Unlike Pai gow poker, the casino does not charge a 5% vigorish for winning wagers. Rather, the house edge comes from winning all \"copy hands\" (a player's hand that is identical to the house's hand). Also, unlike Pai gow poker there are no ties in this game; the player either wins or loses. The House edge figures to be around 3% based on the probability of the player having a losing copy hand.",

The player's \"playing hand\", which will be compared against that of each competing player, is the best 5-card poker hand available from his two hole cards and the five community cards.

In these games, each player is dealt privately an incomplete hand (\"hole cards\"), which are then combined with the community cards to make a complete hand. The set of community cards is called the \"board\", and may be dealt in a simple line or arranged in a special pattern.

            "Asia Poker\nAsia Poker is a casino table game similar to Pai gow poker that is now popular in most Atlantic City, New Jersey casinos. Players are dealt seven cards and divide their cards into three hands: a four-card hand (High), a two-card hand (Medium) and a one-card hand (Low). The four-card hand must be equal or greater in poker ranking than the two-card hand and the two-card hand must be equal or greater than the one-card hand. After all players have set their hand, the dealer sets the house's hand according to the \"house way\" and then compares each player's hand to the house's hand. If the house wins at least two out of three hands, the player loses. If the player wins at least two or out of three hands the player wins. Unlike Pai gow poker, the casino does not charge a 5% vigorish for winning wagers. Rather, the house edge comes from winning all \"copy hands\" (a player's hand that is identical to the house's hand). Also, unlike Pai gow poker there are no ties in this game; the player either wins or loses. The House edge figures to be around 3% based on the probability of the player having a losing copy hand.",

When a player is folding his hand (face down) without saying anything, in fact the hand is not folded until it reaches the muck (it can be taken back and used if the dealer did not take the hand yet). The practice of mucking cards when discarding helps to ensure that no other player can reliably determine which cards were in the folded hand. In poker, the term may also refer to the action that a player who has not folded may take; he can have his hand \"mucked\" if another player attempts to discard but one or more cards end up in the live players hand.

            "Memory of Mankind\nSeveral motivations underlie the project. The primary ambition of MOM is to preserve an image of our era, created by numerous participants all over the planet. MOM will also contain information which our society is obliged to forward to the future: e.g. description of nuclear waste repositories. MOM collaborates with the NEA and SKB. Although the most obvious ambition and often described in the media is the concern about preserving our knowledge, this is not the primary goal of MOM. Serving as a time capsule MOM is both: in a time frame of millennia it is the story about us, and in a time frame of decades it is a backup. In times where global warming, nuclear danger and biological warfare threaten the existence of civilization, saving the core knowledge and culture acquired over centuries is a backup measure. In case of a collapse, the MOM project could help survivors to rebuild civilization. Linked to this, an another reason is of political order: facing the lack of reactivity of authorities concerning global warming, the MOM project is a reminder of what can happen. Roman and Greek civilizations whose histories have been reconstructed by the small percentage of texts and artifacts which survived until our days are examples that have inspired the MOM project. Finally, it's a critic of our digital civilization : according to Kunze, maybe nothing of the 21st century will last in the future, since most of our interactions are now virtual.

            "Work college\nWork colleges are distinctive liberal arts colleges in the United States that promote the purposeful integration of work, learning, and service. At a work college all students work regardless of their academic program or their financial need. A work college is a public or private non-profit, four-year degree-granting institution of higher learning where student work is an integrated, essential and federally required core component of the educational work-learning-service program. Unlike Federal Work Study, which is solely need-based, work colleges do not differentiate between those that can afford to pay for their education from those that must work to cover their educational costs. At work colleges, students are regularly evaluated and assessed on their work performance and can be dismissed from the institution for non-performance in the work program. Students do not have the ability to \"buy\" their way out of the work requirement. Students perform essential institutional functions in every area imaginable on their campuses and gain a strong sense of ownership and responsibility for their campus community. Student labor enables work colleges to be far more operationally efficient and administratively lean (compared to more traditional colleges).

When a player is folding his hand (face down) without saying anything, in fact the hand is not folded until it reaches the muck (it can be taken back and used if the dealer did not take the hand yet). The practice of mucking cards when discarding helps to ensure that no other player can reliably determine which cards were in the folded hand. In poker, the term may also refer to the action that a player who has not folded may take; he can have his hand \"mucked\" if another player attempts to discard but one or more cards end up in the live players hand.

The set of community cards is called the \"board\", and may be dealt in a simple line or arranged in a special pattern.

The stages consist of a series of three cards (\"the flop\"), later an additional single card (\"the turn\" or \"fourth street\"), and a final card (\"the river\" or \"fifth street\"). Each player seeks the best five card poker hand from any combination of the seven cards of the five community cards and their own two hole cards. (If a player's best five-card poker hand consists only of the five community cards and none of the player's hole cards, it is called \"playing the board\".

The four-card hand must be equal or greater in poker ranking than the two-card hand and the two-card hand must be equal or greater than the one-card hand. After all players have set their hand, the dealer sets the house's hand according to the \"house way\" and then compares each player's hand to the house's hand. If the house wins at least two out of three hands, the player loses. If the player wins at least two or out of three hands the player wins. Unlike Pai gow poker, the casino does not charge a 5% vigorish for winning wagers. Rather, the house edge comes from winning all \"copy hands\" (a player's hand that is identical to the house's hand). Also, unlike Pai gow poker there are no ties in this game; the player either wins or loses. The House edge figures to be around 3% based on the probability of the player having a losing copy hand.",
            "Muck (gambling)\nMuck in gambling has multiple meanings. In poker, it most often refers to the pile of discarded cards into which players may throw their folded hands, and into which the dealer may place burned cards. It may also refer to the action of throwing a hand into the muck. When a player is folding his hand (face down) without saying anything, in fact the hand is not folded until it reaches the muck (it can be taken back and used if the dealer did not take the hand yet). The practice of mucking cards when discarding helps to ensure that no other player can reliably determine which cards were in the folded hand. In poker, the term may also refer to the action that a player who has not folded may take; he can have his hand \"mucked\" if another player attempts to discard but one or more cards end up in the live players hand. This is why many players will place a chip or other object on their cards: it helps to prevent errant cards from entering their hand. Sometimes they are referred to as card covers, card guards or card protector.",

When Two Cities was absorbed into the Rank Organisation in the mid-1940s Coen was employed by Sir David Cunynghame of London Film Productions as a subtitler. As Coen later described it in an interview, he did not know anything about subtitling at the time, and learned on the job: I finally got a phone call from London Films, Sir Cunnyngham, that 's it, who asked me whether I had ever subtitles pictures. I immediately said I had when in point of fact I did not know what he meant, and there was a young man in the office with Sir David Cunnynghame called Lew Watt, and he said Lew Watt will do the technical side and we want you to subtitle an Italian picture in to English. I said certainly . I came out of his office and Lew Watt said to me you don't know what they're talking about do you, I said you're quite right, he said well I'll show you. And I started subtitling pictures with Lew Watt, I used to do the literary side, and he used to do the technical side, the spotting, and lengths, and we together did subtitles for 40 or 50 pictures. The funny thing was we subtitled pictures in Chinese, in Indian and for the Chinese picture I had to have a Chinese waiter with me to tell me where the subtitles [...] I had the Italian dialogue and I had the picture, they gave me a film and we did the spotting together with Lew Watt and the measurements and I used to type the script. We had the film, we had the print which used to run on the two sided thing. And Lew Watt was working all the day so we had to do this at night, so we either used to work at night till 2 o'clock in the morning or we used to work at the weekends. There was always the problem that the Movieola might break down and so we had spare keys of other cutting rooms in in elm St in case we were caught. And that was how we started.Coen later founded his own company Kenilworth Film Productions and spent most of the post-war years producing second features.

            "Asia Poker\nAsia Poker is a casino table game similar to Pai gow poker that is now popular in most Atlantic City, New Jersey casinos. Players are dealt seven cards and divide their cards into three hands: a four-card hand (High), a two-card hand (Medium) and a one-card hand (Low). The four-card hand must be equal or greater in poker ranking than the two-card hand and the two-card hand must be equal or greater than the one-card hand.

            "Community card poker\nCommunity card poker refers to any game of poker that uses community cards (also called \"shared cards\" or \"window cards\"), which are cards dealt face up in the center of the table and shared by all players. In these games, each player is dealt privately an incomplete hand (\"hole cards\"), which are then combined with the community cards to make a complete hand. The set of community cards is called the \"board\", and may be dealt in a simple line or arranged in a special pattern. Rules of each game determine how they may be combined with each player's private hand. The most popular community card game today is Texas hold 'em, originating sometime in the 1920s.",
            "Texas hold 'em starting hands\nIn the poker game of Texas hold 'em, a starting hand consists of two \"hole cards\", which belong solely to the player and remain hidden from the other players. Five community cards are also dealt into play. Betting begins before any of the community cards are exposed, and continues throughout the hand. The player's \"playing hand\", which will be compared against that of each competing player, is the best 5-card poker hand available from his two hole cards and the five community cards. Unless otherwise specified, here the term \"hand\" applies to the player's two hole cards, or \"starting hand\".",
            "Asia Poker\nAsia Poker is a casino table game similar to Pai gow poker that is now popular in most Atlantic City, New Jersey casinos. Players are dealt seven cards and divide their cards into three hands: a four-card hand (High), a two-card hand (Medium) and a one-card hand (Low). The four-card hand must be equal or greater in poker ranking than the two-card hand and the two-card hand must be equal or greater than the one-card hand. After all players have set their hand, the dealer sets the house's hand according to the \"house way\" and then compares each player's hand to the house's hand. If the house wins at least two out of three hands, the player loses. If the player wins at least two or out of three hands the player wins. Unlike Pai gow poker, the casino does not charge a 5% vigorish for winning wagers. Rather, the house edge comes from winning all \"copy hands\" (a player's hand that is identical to the house's hand). Also, unlike Pai gow poker there are no ties in this game; the player either wins or loses. The House edge figures to be around 3% based on the probability of the player having a losing copy hand.",
            "Texas hold 'em\nTexas hold 'em (also known as Texas holdem, hold 'em, and holdem) is a variation of the card game of poker. Two cards, known as the hole cards, are dealt face down to each player, and then five community cards are dealt face up in three stages. The stages consist of a series of three cards (\"the flop\"), later an additional single card (\"the turn\" or \"fourth street\"), and a final card (\"the river\" or \"fifth street\"). Each player seeks the best five card poker hand from any combination of the seven cards of the five community cards and their own two hole cards. (If a player's best five-card poker hand consists only of the five community cards and none of the player's hole cards, it is called \"playing the board\". If you play the board on the river, then you can do no better than tie the other player(s) in the game if no player can make a better hand than the board represents, using either or both hole cards.) Players have betting options to check, call, raise, or fold. Rounds of betting take place before the flop is dealt and after each subsequent deal.",
            "Anything's Wild\nAnything's Wild is a video poker game that allows the player to select any card (by rank) to act as the \"wild card\". The game is a variation of Deuces Wild and is based on five card draw where the player is dealt a five card hand. The player can then choose which cards to keep or discard and is dealt new cards accordingly. The payoff is based on the value of the hand. The \"wild card\" is announced before the hand is dealt and can be substituted for any card in the deck according to what is most beneficial to the player's hand. Since the game uses a standard deck, there are always four \"wild cards\" in play. This allows the player greater flexibility in building a winning hand.",
            "Pyramid poker\nPyramid poker is a simplified version of pai gow poker, where instead of seven cards, three cards are dealt face down. It uses a standard 52-card deck without jokers. The hand rankings are just like in poker except that aces are always high. The dealer deals the player and himself 3 cards, which is arranged into a 2 card hand and a 1 card hand which should be smaller than the 2-card hand. There are no straights or flushes in the 2-card hand, and a higher ranked hand wins in both the hands.",
            "Muck (gambling)\nMuck in gambling has multiple meanings. In poker, it most often refers to the pile of discarded cards into which players may throw their folded hands, and into which the dealer may place burned cards. It may also refer to the action of throwing a hand into the muck. When a player is folding his hand (face down) without saying anything, in fact the hand is not folded until it reaches the muck (it can be taken back and used if the dealer did not take the hand yet). The practice of mucking cards when discarding helps to ensure that no other player can reliably determine which cards were in the folded hand. In poker, the term may also refer to the action that a player who has not folded may take; he can have his hand \"mucked\" if another player attempts to discard but one or more cards end up in the live players hand. This is why many players will place a chip or other object on their cards: it helps to prevent errant cards from entering their hand. Sometimes they are referred to as card covers, card guards or card protector.",

            "NaGISA\nNaGISA (Natural Geography in Shore Areas or Natural Geography of In-Shore Areas) is an international collaborative effort aimed at inventorying, cataloguing, and monitoring biodiversity of the in-shore area. So named for the Japanese word \"nagisa\" (\"where the land meets the sea\"), it is an Apronym. NaGISA is the first project of the larger CoML effort (Census of Marine Life) to have global participation in actual field work. The actual procedures of this project involve inexpensive collection equipment (for easy universal participation). This equipment is used to photograph sampling sites, to actually take samples from the sites, and to process these samples. At each site throughout the world, samples are taken from the intertidal zone out to a depth of 10 meters (and optionally out to 20 meters depth). These samples are then processed (the organisms are isolated) and then analyzed and catalogued. The information (regarding the kind and number of organisms analyzed) is sent to the global headquarters of NaGISA- the University of Kyoto in Japan. All of this information is then collated on the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS website). The end goal of the larger CoML effort is to find what \"was\", what \"is\", and what \"will be\" in the world's oceans. For NaGISA the goal is to find this in the world's in-shore areas.",
