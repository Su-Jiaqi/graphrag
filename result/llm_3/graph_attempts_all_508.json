Historical mention of Ji dates to the founding of the Zhou Dynasty in about 1045 BC. Archaeological finds in southwestern Beijing where Ji was believed to be located date to the Spring and Autumn period (771-476 BC). The City of Ji served as the capital of the ancient states of Ji and Yan until the unification of China by the Qin Dynasty in 221 BC. Thereafter, the city was a prefectural capital for Youzhou through the Han Dynasty, Three Kingdoms, Western Jin Dynasty, Sixteen Kingdoms, Northern Dynasties, and Sui Dynasty. With the creation of a Jizhou (\u84df\u5dde) during the Tang Dynasty in what is now Tianjin Municipality, the City of Ji took on the name Youzhou. Youzhou was one of the Sixteen Prefectures ceded to the Khitans during the Five Dynasties. The city then became the southern capital of the Liao Dynasty and then main capital of the Jin Dynasty (1115-1234). In the 13th Century, Kublai Khan built a new capital city for the Yuan Dynasty adjacent to Ji to the north. The old city of Ji became a suburb to Dadu.

It is an astronomical method of calculating the longitude at which a position line, drawn from a sight by sextant of any celestial body, crosses the observer's assumed latitude. In order to calculate the position line, the time of the sight must be known so that the celestial position i.e. the Greenwich Hour Angle (Celestial Longitude - measured in a westerly direction from Greenwich) and Declination (Celestial Latitude - measured north or south of the equational or celestial equator), of the observed celestial body is known. All that can be derived from a single sight is a single position line, which can be achieved at any time during daylight, when both the sea horizon and the sun are visible. To achieve a fix, more than one celestial body and the sea horizon must be visible. This is usually only possible at dawn and dusk.",

It is an astronomical method of calculating the longitude at which a position line, drawn from a sight by sextant of any celestial body, crosses the observer's assumed latitude. In order to calculate the position line, the time of the sight must be known so that the celestial position i.e. the Greenwich Hour Angle (Celestial Longitude - measured in a westerly direction from Greenwich) and Declination (Celestial Latitude - measured north or south of the equational or celestial equator), of the observed celestial body is known. All that can be derived from a single sight is a single position line, which can be achieved at any time during daylight, when both the sea horizon and the sun are visible. To achieve a fix, more than one celestial body and the sea horizon must be visible. This is usually only possible at dawn and dusk.",

            "Longitude by chronometer\nLongitude by chronometer is a method, in navigation, of determining longitude using a marine chronometer, which was developed by John Harrison during the first half of the eighteenth century. It is an astronomical method of calculating the longitude at which a position line, drawn from a sight by sextant of any celestial body, crosses the observer's assumed latitude. In order to calculate the position line, the time of the sight must be known so that the celestial position i.e. the Greenwich Hour Angle (Celestial Longitude - measured in a westerly direction from Greenwich) and Declination (Celestial Latitude - measured north or south of the equational or celestial equator), of the observed celestial body is known. All that can be derived from a single sight is a single position line, which can be achieved at any time during daylight, when both the sea horizon and the sun are visible. To achieve a fix, more than one celestial body and the sea horizon must be visible. This is usually only possible at dawn and dusk.",

            "To calculate the coordinates 808 nautical miles northwest from Honolulu, we can use the principles of geographic navigation. \n\nFirst, we need to convert the distance from nautical miles to degrees of latitude and longitude. One nautical mile is approximately equal to one minute of latitude. Therefore, 808 nautical miles is roughly equal to 808 minutes of latitude.\n\nTo find the new latitude, we subtract 808 minutes from the latitude of Honolulu:\n21.3069\u00b0 N - 808' = 20.5069\u00b0 N\n\nNext, we need to calculate the change in longitude. The conversion from nautical miles to degrees of longitude varies depending on the latitude, but for simplicity, we can use the approximation that one minute of longitude is equal to one nautical mile at the equator. At the latitude of Honolulu, which is approximately 21.3069\u00b0 N, the conversion is slightly different, but for this calculation, we will use the approximation.\n\nWe can use the cosine of the latitude to adjust for the difference in longitude degrees per nautical mile. The cosine of 21.3069\u00b0 is approximately 0.928. Therefore, we can calculate the change in longitude by dividing 808 nautical miles by 0.928, which gives us approximately 871.55 minutes of longitude.\n\nTo find the new longitude, we subtract 871.55 minutes from the longitude of Honolulu:\n157.8583\u00b0 W - 871.55' = 156.9867\u00b0 W\n\nTherefore, the coordinates 808 nautical miles northwest from Honolulu are approximately 20.5069\u00b0 N latitude and 156.9867\u00b0 W longitude.",

Since we are moving northwest, we will subtract the latitude and longitude values. \n\n3. For latitude, we will subtract 808 minutes from the latitude of Honolulu (21.3069\u00b0 N). \n   New latitude = 21.3069\u00b0 N - (808/60) = 21.3069\u00b0 N - 13.4667\u00b0 = 7.8402\u00b0 N\n\n4.

Since we are going northwest from Honolulu, we will subtract the latitude and longitude values.\n\n3. For latitude, we will subtract 808 minutes from the latitude of Honolulu (21.3069\u00b0 N).
