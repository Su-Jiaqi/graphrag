A projection of the number of facilities and resources needed to provide adequate healthcare services to Singapore's ageing population in 2030 revealed serious shortfalls. In response to the problem of inadequate healthcare facilities for the elderly, a group of 8 churches and Christian organisations including the Graduate Christian Fellowship and the Singapore Nurses' Christian Fellowship came together to set up St Luke's Hospital for the Elderly Sick.

After miraculously surviving the punishment, the fort is attacked by an indigenous alien race called the Ferox. Everyone in the fort is killed except Sven, and the leader takes a liking to him. Sven then goes on to live with the primitive race of killing beasts. Several months later the Ferox are attacked by an elite human military force that is under the control of the empire of OctoV called Death's Head. They take Sven captive, taking him to their ship. There he is recruited and learns that he's special in the fact that he is not entirely human, which explains his remarkable healing abilities and fighting prowess. Sven goes through several tests, including surviving a stint on a frozen prison planet, and successfully assassinating a senator. After being fully admitted into Death's Head, Sven then goes on to fight the Uplifted, sworn enemies of OctoV's empire. Behind the two civilizations is the United Free, a race so technologically advanced they are seen as gods.

In an effort to distinguish themselves from other American groups and tie-in with the popular British Invasion, they lured Scottish vocalist Dave Ottley to join the group. Eventually they became the most popular band in the Washington, DC area, having a huge regional hit with \"What a Girl Can\u2019t Do\", that appeared on Monument Records, but had actually been recorded by an earlier local group, the Reekers, whose membership included two future Hangmen, Tom Guernsey and Bob Berberich. The single was nonetheless credited to the Hangmen. The song became so popular that the band was greeted with near \"Beatlemanic\" adoration from fans, whose enthusiasm on one occasion erupted into a near riot. The group followed-up with the single \"Faces\", which featured more aggressive sound, replete with a snide vocal from Ottley and a razor-like fuzz-driven guitar riff. Ottley shortly thereafter departed from the band and was replaced by Tony Taylor. The group, now with Taylor, went to Nashville to record the album \"Bittersweet\", which displayed a more eclectic and relaxed approach, which, despite its closing song, a raucous version of Van Morrison's' Gloria\", stood in marked contrast to their previous efforts. The album's opening cut was sitar-embellished version of \"Dream Baby, which was also released as a single. After additional rounds of lineup changes and in an effort to emphasize their increasingly psychedelic orientation, the Hangmen changed their name to the Button. As the Button, they taped an unreleased set of songs for RCA Records in New York, but subsequently changed their name to Graffiti and recorded briefly for ABC Records."
