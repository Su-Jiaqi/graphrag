            "Jean-Jacques Beineix\nJean-Jacques Beineix (] ; born 8 October 1946) is a French film director and generally seen as the best example of what came to be called the \"cin\u00e9ma du look\". Critic Ginette Vincendeau defined the films made by Beineix and others as \"youth-oriented films with high production values...The \"look\" of the \"cin\u00e9ma du look\" refers to the films' high investment in non-naturalistic, self-conscious aesthetics, notably intense colours and lighting effects. Their spectacular (studio based) and technically brilliant \"mise-en-sc\u00e8ne\" is usually put to the service of romantic plots.\" The \"cin\u00e9ma du look\" included the films of Luc Besson and L\u00e9os Carax. Luc Besson, like Beineix, was much maligned by the critical establishment during the 1980s, while Carax was much admired. In late 2006, Beineix published a first volume of his autobiography, \"Les Chantiers de la gloire\" (in French only). The title alluded to the French title of Stanley Kubrick's film, \"Les Sentiers de la gloire\" (\"Paths of Glory\").",
