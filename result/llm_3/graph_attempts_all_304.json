The premise of the scene, that laughter and happiness cause Uncle Albert (and like-minded visitors) to float into the air, can be seen as a metaphor for the way laughter can \"lighten\" a mood. (Compare Peter Pan's flight power, which is also powered by happy thoughts.) Conversely, thinking of something sad literally brings Albert and his visitors \"down to earth\" again. The song states a case strongly in favor of laughter, even if Mary Poppins appears to disapprove of Uncle Albert's behavior, especially since it not only complicates the task of getting Albert down, but the infectious mood sends Bert and the Banks children into the air as well."

Additionally, the Bud Bowl advertising campaign featured anthropomorphized Budweiser bottles playing a football game against Bud Light bottles, further solidifying Budweiser's dominance in the market.\n\nIt is important to note that while there were other beer brands with dog mascots during the 1980s, none were direct rivals to Bud Light in the same way that Stroh's was not a direct competitor to Bud Light.

            "The Budweiser dog mascot created in the 1980s to promote Bud Light is Spuds MacKenzie.

During the height of his popularity, Spuds MacKenzie was featured in Super Bowl ads and had a wide range of merchandise available, such as plush toys and t-shirts.",
            "The brewer that used a character called Alex the Dog in its marketing is not mentioned in the provided information.",
            "Based on the information provided, it can be determined that the marketing competition context between the two breweries in the 1980s was intense. Budweiser's use of the popular and widely recognized mascot, Spuds MacKenzie, for their Bud Light beer created a significant impact on their marketing efforts. The extensive advertising campaign, featuring Spuds MacKenzie in Super Bowl ads and a wide range of merchandise, contributed to Bud Light's brand recognition and popularity.\n\nOn the other hand, the lack of information about the brewery using a character called Alex the Dog suggests that their marketing efforts may not have been as prominent or successful as Budweiser's during the 1980s. This indicates that Budweiser had a competitive advantage in the marketing arena, potentially leading to a stronger market presence and consumer appeal for their beer products compared to the other brewery."

NaGISA is the first project of the larger CoML effort (Census of Marine Life) to have global participation in actual field work. The actual procedures of this project involve inexpensive collection equipment (for easy universal participation). This equipment is used to photograph sampling sites, to actually take samples from the sites, and to process these samples. At each site throughout the world, samples are taken from the intertidal zone out to a depth of 10 meters (and optionally out to 20 meters depth). These samples are then processed (the organisms are isolated) and then analyzed and catalogued. The information (regarding the kind and number of organisms analyzed) is sent to the global headquarters of NaGISA- the University of Kyoto in Japan. All of this information is then collated on the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS website). The end goal of the larger CoML effort is to find what \"was\", what \"is\", and what \"will be\" in the world's oceans. For NaGISA the goal is to find this in the world's in-shore areas.",

            "Alex the Dog\nAlex the Dog was the advertising mascot for Stroh's beer in the 1980s and precursor to Budweiser's Spuds MacKenzie.

Hip-hop artist Tone Loc referenced Alex the Dog in his song \"Funky Cold Medina\".",
            "Postpipe\nIn archaeology, a postpipe (or post pipe) is the remains of an upright timber placed in a posthole. Given the right conditions, timbers may survive over long periods of time and a recovered postpipe can simply be of solid wood. Under less preservative conditions however, only a dark circular stain of organic material may be left in the fill of the posthole observable in plan and section. This differs in consistency from the less organic backfill of the posthole and can be identified simply through this change in make-up. The size and depth and of the postpipe can provide information as to any reuse of the posthole especially if several different postpipes can be identified. They can also indicate the species of wood used and help suggest the nature of the structure that the timber once supported. The term was first used by Maud Cunnington when she excavated the site of Woodhenge in the English county of Wiltshire during the 1920s and found numerous examples of decomposed timber posts.",

According to SETF, it is also committed to supporting the overthrow of the government of Cuba; a statement co-signed by it and the Florida-based Cuban exile organization \"Assembly of the Resistance\" declared it would work for \"the overthrow of the dictatorial regimes of Assad and Castro.\"",
            "Bede Aircraft\nBede Aircraft Corporation was founded by controversial aeronautical engineer Jim Bede in 1961 to produce the BD-1 kit aircraft, which eventually became the American Aviation Corporation's AA-1. The company also created and produced a number of advanced kit planes including the famous Bede BD-5 (pusher propeller driven) and BD-5J (turbojet driven). The BD-5J has held the Guinness record as the World's Smallest Jet Aircraft for more than a quarter century. Versions of it saw use in various Budweiser commercials (the Bud Light Jet, which was lost in an inflight fire and crash unrelated to airshow work). The tiny jet also appeared in two James Bond movies; \"Octopussy\" starring Sir Roger Moore, and later in a cameo appearance, hanging from the wall of Q's workshop in \"Die Another Day\" starring Pierce Brosnan as Agent 007.",

            "Publication bias\nPublication bias is a type of bias that occurs in published academic research. It occurs when the outcome of an experiment or research study influences the decision whether to publish or otherwise distribute it. Publication bias matters because literature reviews regarding support for a hypothesis can be biased if the original literature is contaminated by publication bias. Publishing only results that show a significant finding disturbs the balance of findings."
