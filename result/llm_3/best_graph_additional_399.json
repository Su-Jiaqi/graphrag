Although primarily a sports video game, \"Horse Racing\" was actually assigned to the Gaming Network, due to its pari-mutuel betting for placing bets on the horses during the game; the game houses 8 virtual Thoroughbred race horses residing in the fictional \"Rainbow Thoroughbred Stables\" at a fictional western Kentucky race track called \"Plympton Downs\" (based loosely on long-time sportscaster/Intellivision sales personality George Plimpton). Each of the horses have differing racing abilities (front runner, pace keeper, come from behind, ...), and do vary from game time to game time (a horse with come from behind traits during one match may have front runner abilities during the next match). These horses are known by their colors (instead of their post position numbers\u2014unlike in regular horse racing).",
