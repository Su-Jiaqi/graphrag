The Lions entered their third season under head coach Rod Marinelli and were looking to improve on the 7\u20139 record they put together in 2007. Instead, the Lions had one of the worst seasons in pro sports history. The team lost all sixteen of their games in 2008, becoming the first team since the 1976 Tampa Bay Buccaneers to end an NFL season with no wins and no tied games as well as the first and only team to do it since the schedule was expanded to sixteen games. The Lions were mathematically eliminated from the playoffs by Week 11, when they stood 0\u201310. The team's victory over the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 16 of 2007 stood as their last until Week 3 of the 2009 season. From the time the Lions recorded a win over the Denver Broncos in 2007 to reach 6\u20132, the team went 5\u201347 over their following 52 games (including all of 2008 and 2009) before winning four games in a row at the end of the 2010 season. As of 2017, this is the only team in NFL history to finish a season with a 0\u201316 record. The 2016 Cleveland Browns and the 2009 St. Louis Rams came close to 0\u201316, both going 1\u201315.",
