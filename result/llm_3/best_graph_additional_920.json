The majority of the stories include jarring violent scenes that make the characters undergo a spiritual change. The short stories commonly have tones of Catholicism related to life and death scenarios. For instance, in the story \"A Good Man Is Hard To Find\" the villain states, \"She would have been a good woman if it had been somebody there to shoot her every minute of her life.\"",

Henson's autobiography, \"The Life of Josiah Henson, Formerly a Slave, Now an Inhabitant of Canada, as Narrated by Himself\" (1849), is believed to have inspired the title character of Harriet Beecher Stowe's \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" (1852). Following the success of Stowe's novel, Henson issued an expanded version of his memoir in 1858, \"Truth Stranger Than Fiction. Father Henson's Story of His Own Life\" (published Boston: John P. Jewett & Company, 1858). Interest in his life continued, and nearly two decades later, his life story was updated and published as \"Uncle Tom's Story of His Life: An Autobiography of the Rev. Josiah Henson\" (1876)."
