These texts mention the deity Osiris, who became the most important figure associated with the afterlife in Ancient Egyptian religion. The Osiris myth, which is the most influential story in ancient Egyptian mythology, also plays a significant role in the concept of afterlife judgment. It involves the murder of Osiris, his resurrection, and the conflict between his son Horus and his murderer Set, ultimately leading to Horus's triumph and the restoration of order in Egypt.\n\nIn addition, the Ancient Egyptian offering formula, known as the \u1e25tp-d\u1ec9-nsw formula, was written as an offering for the deceased to partake in offerings presented to major deities in the name of the king, or in offerings presented directly to the deceased by family members. This reflects the belief in the afterlife judgment and the importance of providing offerings to ensure a favorable outcome in the afterlife.\n\nOverall, the Ancient Egyptian concept of afterlife judgment is closely tied to the mythology, rituals, and beliefs surrounding deities such as Osiris and Ra, as well as the practice of offering formulas to ensure a positive outcome in the afterlife.",

It is part of the ancient Egyptian belief in the afterlife and the judgment of the soul. According to mythology, after death, the soul of the deceased would undergo judgment in the Hall of Ma'at, where the heart of the deceased would be weighed against the feather of Ma'at, the goddess of truth and justice.\n\nThe symbolism of this ceremony is profound, as the heart was considered the center of intelligence and emotion in ancient Egyptian belief. The heart was believed to contain the essence of a person's character and deeds. If the heart was found to be lighter than the feather of Ma'at, it meant that the deceased had lived a virtuous life and would be granted entry into the afterlife. However, if the heart was heavy with sin and wrongdoing, it would be devoured by the demon Ammit, and the soul would be condemned to eternal punishment.\n\nThe weighing of the heart ceremony reflects the importance of moral and ethical conduct in ancient Egyptian society. It served as a reminder to the living to uphold truth, justice, and righteousness in their lives, as their actions would be judged in the afterlife. The ceremony also emphasized the belief in the continuity of existence beyond death and the accountability of the soul for its actions.\n\nOverall, the weighing of the heart ceremony in Egyptian mythology holds deep symbolic and spiritual significance, reflecting the ancient Egyptian beliefs in the afterlife, moral conduct, and the eternal judgment of the soul.",

NaGISA is the first project of the larger CoML effort (Census of Marine Life) to have global participation in actual field work. The actual procedures of this project involve inexpensive collection equipment (for easy universal participation). This equipment is used to photograph sampling sites, to actually take samples from the sites, and to process these samples. At each site throughout the world, samples are taken from the intertidal zone out to a depth of 10 meters (and optionally out to 20 meters depth). These samples are then processed (the organisms are isolated) and then analyzed and catalogued. The information (regarding the kind and number of organisms analyzed) is sent to the global headquarters of NaGISA- the University of Kyoto in Japan. All of this information is then collated on the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS website). The end goal of the larger CoML effort is to find what \"was\", what \"is\", and what \"will be\" in the world's oceans. For NaGISA the goal is to find this in the world's in-shore areas.",

Anubis, the god of mummification and the afterlife, oversees the ceremony, while Thoth, the god of wisdom, records the results.\n\nThe symbolism of the weighing of the heart ceremony is profound. The heart represents the essence of the individual, their emotions, thoughts, and deeds in life. It is believed that the heart is the seat of consciousness and morality in Egyptian mythology. The feather of Ma'at represents truth, harmony, and cosmic order. If the heart is lighter than the feather, it means that the deceased lived a righteous life and upheld the principles of Ma'at. As a result, they are deemed worthy to enter the afterlife and be reunited with the gods. However, if the heart is heavier than the feather, it signifies that the individual led a sinful and immoral life, and they would face punishment in the afterlife.\n\nThe weighing of the heart ceremony reflects the ancient Egyptian belief in the importance of moral conduct and ethical behavior. It serves as a moral and spiritual guide for the living, emphasizing the values of truth, justice, and righteousness. The ritual also underscores the concept of accountability and the consequences of one's actions in the afterlife. Overall, the ceremony holds great significance in Egyptian mythology as a representation of the eternal struggle between good and evil and the pursuit of spiritual enlightenment.",

The remainder of the story focuses on Horus, the product of the union of Isis and Osiris, who is at first a vulnerable child protected by his mother and then becomes Set's rival for the throne. Their often violent conflict ends with Horus's triumph, which restores order to Egypt after Set's unrighteous reign and completes the process of Osiris's resurrection.

The weighing of the heart ceremony served as a moral and ethical guide for the living, encouraging them to uphold the principles of truth, justice, and righteousness.\n\nOverall, the weighing of the heart ceremony in Egyptian mythology holds great significance in understanding the ancient Egyptian beliefs about the afterlife, morality, and the judgment of the soul.",

            "Osiris myth\nThe Osiris myth is the most elaborate and influential story in ancient Egyptian mythology. It concerns the murder of the god Osiris, a primeval king of Egypt, and its consequences. Osiris's murderer, his brother Set, usurps his throne. Meanwhile, Osiris's wife Isis restores her husband's body, allowing him to posthumously conceive a son with her. The remainder of the story focuses on Horus, the product of the union of Isis and Osiris, who is at first a vulnerable child protected by his mother and then becomes Set's rival for the throne. Their often violent conflict ends with Horus's triumph, which restores order to Egypt after Set's unrighteous reign and completes the process of Osiris's resurrection. The myth, with its complex symbolism, is integral to the Egyptian conceptions of kingship and succession, conflict between order and disorder, and especially death and the afterlife.

            "Osiris myth\nThe Osiris myth is the most elaborate and influential story in ancient Egyptian mythology. It concerns the murder of the god Osiris, a primeval king of Egypt, and its consequences. Osiris's murderer, his brother Set, usurps his throne. Meanwhile, Osiris's wife Isis restores her husband's body, allowing him to posthumously conceive a son with her. The remainder of the story focuses on Horus, the product of the union of Isis and Osiris, who is at first a vulnerable child protected by his mother and then becomes Set's rival for the throne. Their often violent conflict ends with Horus's triumph, which restores order to Egypt after Set's unrighteous reign and completes the process of Osiris's resurrection. The myth, with its complex symbolism, is integral to the Egyptian conceptions of kingship and succession, conflict between order and disorder, and especially death and the afterlife. It also expresses the essential character of each of the four deities at its center, and many elements of their worship in ancient Egyptian religion were derived from the myth.",

When Two Cities was absorbed into the Rank Organisation in the mid-1940s Coen was employed by Sir David Cunynghame of London Film Productions as a subtitler. As Coen later described it in an interview, he did not know anything about subtitling at the time, and learned on the job: I finally got a phone call from London Films, Sir Cunnyngham, that 's it, who asked me whether I had ever subtitles pictures. I immediately said I had when in point of fact I did not know what he meant, and there was a young man in the office with Sir David Cunnynghame called Lew Watt, and he said Lew Watt will do the technical side and we want you to subtitle an Italian picture in to English. I said certainly . I came out of his office and Lew Watt said to me you don't know what they're talking about do you, I said you're quite right, he said well I'll show you. And I started subtitling pictures with Lew Watt, I used to do the literary side, and he used to do the technical side, the spotting, and lengths, and we together did subtitles for 40 or 50 pictures. The funny thing was we subtitled pictures in Chinese, in Indian and for the Chinese picture I had to have a Chinese waiter with me to tell me where the subtitles [...] I had the Italian dialogue and I had the picture, they gave me a film and we did the spotting together with Lew Watt and the measurements and I used to type the script. We had the film, we had the print which used to run on the two sided thing. And Lew Watt was working all the day so we had to do this at night, so we either used to work at night till 2 o'clock in the morning or we used to work at the weekends. There was always the problem that the Movieola might break down and so we had spare keys of other cutting rooms in in elm St in case we were caught.

            "Work college\nWork colleges are distinctive liberal arts colleges in the United States that promote the purposeful integration of work, learning, and service. At a work college all students work regardless of their academic program or their financial need. A work college is a public or private non-profit, four-year degree-granting institution of higher learning where student work is an integrated, essential and federally required core component of the educational work-learning-service program. Unlike Federal Work Study, which is solely need-based, work colleges do not differentiate between those that can afford to pay for their education from those that must work to cover their educational costs. At work colleges, students are regularly evaluated and assessed on their work performance and can be dismissed from the institution for non-performance in the work program. Students do not have the ability to \"buy\" their way out of the work requirement. Students perform essential institutional functions in every area imaginable on their campuses and gain a strong sense of ownership and responsibility for their campus community. Student labor enables work colleges to be far more operationally efficient and administratively lean (compared to more traditional colleges). This, in turn, contributes to lower operational costs which results in lower \u2013 and more affordable \u2013 tuition."

The remainder of the story focuses on Horus, the product of the union of Isis and Osiris, who is at first a vulnerable child protected by his mother and then becomes Set's rival for the throne. Their often violent conflict ends with Horus's triumph, which restores order to Egypt after Set's unrighteous reign and completes the process of Osiris's resurrection.

            "Osiris myth\nThe Osiris myth is the most elaborate and influential story in ancient Egyptian mythology. It concerns the murder of the god Osiris, a primeval king of Egypt, and its consequences. Osiris's murderer, his brother Set, usurps his throne. Meanwhile, Osiris's wife Isis restores her husband's body, allowing him to posthumously conceive a son with her. The remainder of the story focuses on Horus, the product of the union of Isis and Osiris, who is at first a vulnerable child protected by his mother and then becomes Set's rival for the throne. Their often violent conflict ends with Horus's triumph, which restores order to Egypt after Set's unrighteous reign and completes the process of Osiris's resurrection. The myth, with its complex symbolism, is integral to the Egyptian conceptions of kingship and succession, conflict between order and disorder, and especially death and the afterlife. It also expresses the essential character of each of the four deities at its center, and many elements of their worship in ancient Egyptian religion were derived from the myth.",
            "Ancient Egyptian deities\nAncient Egyptian deities are the gods and goddesses worshipped in ancient Egypt. The beliefs and rituals surrounding these gods formed the core of ancient Egyptian religion, which emerged sometime in prehistory. Deities represented natural forces and phenomena, and the Egyptians supported and appeased them through offerings and rituals so that these forces would continue to function according to \"maat\", or divine order. After the founding of the Egyptian state around 3100\u00a0BC, the authority to perform these tasks was controlled by the pharaoh, who claimed to be the gods' representative and managed the temples where the rituals were carried out.",

            "Sikh art and culture\nThe Sikhs are adherents to Sikhism the fifth largest organized religion in the world, with around 23 million adherents. Sikh History is around 500 years and in that time the Sikhs have developed unique expressions of art and culture which are influenced by their faith and synthesize traditions from many other cultures. Sikhism is Punjab's only indigenous religion with all other religions coming from outside Punjab (with the possible exception of Punjabi Hinduism since the oldest Hindu scripture \u2013 the Rig Veda \u2013 was composed in the Punjab region. Some other religions, like Jainism, may also claim to have originated in Punjab since Jain symbolism has been found among artifacts of the Indus Valley Civilization). All the Sikh gurus, saints and majority of the martyrs in Sikh history were from Punjab and from the Punjabi people. Punjabi culture and Sikhism are considered inseparably intertwined. \"Sikh\" properly refers to adherents of Sikhism as a religion, not an ethnic group. However, because Sikhism has seldom sought converts, most Sikhs share strong ethno-religious ties. Many countries, such as the U.K., therefore recognize Sikh as a designated ethnicity on their censuses. The American non-profit organization United Sikhs has fought to have Sikh included on the U.S. census as well, arguing that Sikhs \"self-identify as an 'ethnic minority'\" and believe \"that they are more than just a religion\".",
