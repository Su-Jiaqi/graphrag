            "A Flex-fuel vehicle, also known as a flexible-fuel vehicle or dual-fuel vehicle, is an alternative fuel vehicle with an internal combustion engine designed to run on more than one fuel. These vehicles are capable of running on a blend of gasoline and either ethanol or methanol fuel, with both fuels stored in the same common tank. Modern flex-fuel engines can adjust fuel injection and spark timing automatically based on the actual blend detected by a fuel composition sensor. This distinguishes them from bi-fuel vehicles, where two fuels are stored in separate tanks and the engine runs on one fuel at a time. In the United States, flex-fuel vehicles are the second largest flex-fuel fleet in the world, with about 17.4 million cars and light trucks in operation as of 2014. Despite the growing fleet of E85 flex-fuel vehicles, actual use of ethanol fuel is limited due to the lack of E85 refueling infrastructure and lack of awareness among American flex-fuel car owners. Flex-fuel vehicles are common in the Midwest, where corn is a major crop and the primary feedstock for ethanol fuel production. Additionally, the U.S. government has been using flex-fuel vehicles for many years.",
            "Hydrogen is used as a fuel in vehicles in a variety of ways. One common method is through fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) or fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs), which use a fuel cell to generate electricity to power the vehicle's motor, generally using oxygen from the air and compressed hydrogen. Most FCVs are classified as zero-emissions vehicles, emitting only water and heat. Another method is through hydrogen vehicles, which use hydrogen as its onboard fuel for motive power, either by burning hydrogen in an internal combustion engine or by reacting hydrogen with oxygen in a fuel cell to run electric motors. Additionally, hydrogen can be used in bi-fuel vehicles, where the vehicle is capable of running on two fuels, such as gasoline or diesel and an alternate fuel like natural gas, LPG, or hydrogen. In the United States, there has been a focus on hydrogen research and the development of fuel cells suitable to power electric motor vehicles.

When Two Cities was absorbed into the Rank Organisation in the mid-1940s Coen was employed by Sir David Cunynghame of London Film Productions as a subtitler. As Coen later described it in an interview, he did not know anything about subtitling at the time, and learned on the job: I finally got a phone call from London Films, Sir Cunnyngham, that 's it, who asked me whether I had ever subtitles pictures. I immediately said I had when in point of fact I did not know what he meant, and there was a young man in the office with Sir David Cunnynghame called Lew Watt, and he said Lew Watt will do the technical side and we want you to subtitle an Italian picture in to English. I said certainly . I came out of his office and Lew Watt said to me you don't know what they're talking about do you, I said you're quite right, he said well I'll show you. And I started subtitling pictures with Lew Watt, I used to do the literary side, and he used to do the technical side, the spotting, and lengths, and we together did subtitles for 40 or 50 pictures. The funny thing was we subtitled pictures in Chinese, in Indian and for the Chinese picture I had to have a Chinese waiter with me to tell me where the subtitles [...] I had the Italian dialogue and I had the picture, they gave me a film and we did the spotting together with Lew Watt and the measurements and I used to type the script. We had the film, we had the print which used to run on the two sided thing. And Lew Watt was working all the day so we had to do this at night, so we either used to work at night till 2 o'clock in the morning or we used to work at the weekends. There was always the problem that the Movieola might break down and so we had spare keys of other cutting rooms in in elm St in case we were caught. And that was how we started.Coen later founded his own company Kenilworth Film Productions and spent most of the post-war years producing second features.

He and his family were interned in Douglas on the Isle of Man during the Second World War. He began his career working for Filippo Del Giudice and Two Cities Films. When Two Cities was absorbed into the Rank Organisation in the mid-1940s Coen was employed by Sir David Cunynghame of London Film Productions as a subtitler. As Coen later described it in an interview, he did not know anything about subtitling at the time, and learned on the job: I finally got a phone call from London Films, Sir Cunnyngham, that 's it, who asked me whether I had ever subtitles pictures. I immediately said I had when in point of fact I did not know what he meant, and there was a young man in the office with Sir David Cunnynghame called Lew Watt, and he said Lew Watt will do the technical side and we want you to subtitle an Italian picture in to English. I said certainly . I came out of his office and Lew Watt said to me you don't know what they're talking about do you, I said you're quite right, he said well I'll show you. And I started subtitling pictures with Lew Watt, I used to do the literary side, and he used to do the technical side, the spotting, and lengths, and we together did subtitles for 40 or 50 pictures. The funny thing was we subtitled pictures in Chinese, in Indian and for the Chinese picture I had to have a Chinese waiter with me to tell me where the subtitles [...] I had the Italian dialogue and I had the picture, they gave me a film and we did the spotting together with Lew Watt and the measurements and I used to type the script. We had the film, we had the print which used to run on the two sided thing. And Lew Watt was working all the day so we had to do this at night, so we either used to work at night till 2 o'clock in the morning or we used to work at the weekends. There was always the problem that the Movieola might break down and so we had spare keys of other cutting rooms in in elm St in case we were caught. And that was how we started.Coen later founded his own company Kenilworth Film Productions and spent most of the post-war years producing second features.

NaGISA is the first project of the larger CoML effort (Census of Marine Life) to have global participation in actual field work. The actual procedures of this project involve inexpensive collection equipment (for easy universal participation). This equipment is used to photograph sampling sites, to actually take samples from the sites, and to process these samples. At each site throughout the world, samples are taken from the intertidal zone out to a depth of 10 meters (and optionally out to 20 meters depth). These samples are then processed (the organisms are isolated) and then analyzed and catalogued. The information (regarding the kind and number of organisms analyzed) is sent to the global headquarters of NaGISA- the University of Kyoto in Japan. All of this information is then collated on the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS website). The end goal of the larger CoML effort is to find what \"was\", what \"is\", and what \"will be\" in the world's oceans. For NaGISA the goal is to find this in the world's in-shore areas.",
            "Work college\nWork colleges are distinctive liberal arts colleges in the United States that promote the purposeful integration of work, learning, and service. At a work college all students work regardless of their academic program or their financial need. A work college is a public or private non-profit, four-year degree-granting institution of higher learning where student work is an integrated, essential and federally required core component of the educational work-learning-service program. Unlike Federal Work Study, which is solely need-based, work colleges do not differentiate between those that can afford to pay for their education from those that must work to cover their educational costs. At work colleges, students are regularly evaluated and assessed on their work performance and can be dismissed from the institution for non-performance in the work program. Students do not have the ability to \"buy\" their way out of the work requirement. Students perform essential institutional functions in every area imaginable on their campuses and gain a strong sense of ownership and responsibility for their campus community. Student labor enables work colleges to be far more operationally efficient and administratively lean (compared to more traditional colleges). This, in turn, contributes to lower operational costs which results in lower \u2013 and more affordable \u2013 tuition."

            "Flex-fuel vehicles are vehicles that are designed to run on more than one type of fuel, typically gasoline and ethanol blends. These vehicles have a flexible fuel system that allows them to use a variety of fuel mixtures, from pure gasoline to a blend of up to 85% ethanol (E85). Flex-fuel vehicles are equipped with sensors and a computer system that can adjust the engine's fuel injection and ignition timing to accommodate different fuel mixtures.\n\nCharacteristics of flex-fuel vehicles include the ability to use ethanol blends, such as E85, in addition to regular gasoline. These vehicles are designed to be compatible with a range of fuel mixtures, making them more versatile and potentially more environmentally friendly. Flex-fuel vehicles are also identified by a special badge or label on the vehicle indicating their capability to use alternative fuel sources.\n\nIn summary, flex-fuel vehicles are designed to run on a variety of fuel mixtures, including ethanol blends, and are equipped with the technology to adjust the engine's performance based on the type of fuel being used.",

These vehicles generate electricity to power the motor using oxygen from the air and compressed hydrogen, and are classified as zero-emissions vehicles that emit only water and heat.\n\nHydrogen vehicles, including fuel cell vehicles, use hydrogen as their onboard fuel for motive power. The power plants of such vehicles convert the chemical energy of hydrogen to mechanical energy either by burning hydrogen in an internal combustion engine or by reacting hydrogen with oxygen in a fuel cell to run electric motors.\n\nThe Mazda RX-8 Hydrogen RE is an example of a bi-fuel vehicle, with a twin-rotor wankel rotary engine configured to run on either hydrogen or gasoline.

It occurs when the outcome of an experiment or research study influences the decision whether to publish or otherwise distribute it. Publication bias matters because literature reviews regarding support for a hypothesis can be biased if the original literature is contaminated by publication bias. Publishing only results that show a significant finding disturbs the balance of findings.",

            "Flex-fuel vehicles, also known as flexible-fuel vehicles, are alternative fuel vehicles with internal combustion engines designed to run on more than one fuel, typically gasoline blended with ethanol or methanol. These vehicles are capable of burning any proportion of the resulting blend in the combustion chamber, as fuel injection and spark timing are adjusted automatically according to the actual blend detected by a fuel composition sensor. Flex-fuel vehicles are distinguished from bi-fuel vehicles, where two fuels are stored in separate tanks and the engine runs on one fuel at a time.\n\nIn the United States, flex-fuel vehicles are the second largest flex-fuel fleet in the world after Brazil, with about 17.4 million flex-fuel cars and light trucks in operation by the end of 2014. However, the actual use of ethanol fuel is limited due to the lack of E85 refueling infrastructure and a lack of awareness among American flex-fuel car owners. Flex-fuel vehicles are common in the Midwest, where corn is a major crop and the primary feedstock for ethanol fuel production.\n\nIn contrast, fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) use a fuel cell, instead of a battery, to power its on-board electric motor. These vehicles generate electricity to power the motor using oxygen from the air and compressed hydrogen, and are classified as zero-emissions vehicles that emit only water and heat. Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) use chemical energy stored in rechargeable battery packs to power electric motors, while hydrogen vehicles use hydrogen as its onboard fuel for motive power.\n\nBi-fuel vehicles, on the other hand, are capable of running on two fuels, with one fuel being gasoline or diesel, and the other being an alternate fuel such as natural gas, LPG, or hydrogen. These vehicles have the capability to switch back and forth from gasoline or diesel to the other fuel, manually or automatically.\n\nOverall, flex-fuel vehicles offer the flexibility to run on multiple fuels, providing potential environmental and economic benefits, but their widespread use is limited by infrastructure and awareness challenges.",

            "Fuel cell vehicle\nA fuel cell vehicle (FCV) or fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) is a type of electric vehicle which uses a fuel cell, instead of a battery, or in combination with a battery or supercapacitor, to power its on-board electric motor. Fuel cells in vehicles generate electricity to power the motor, generally using oxygen from the air and compressed hydrogen. Most fuel cell vehicles are classified as zero-emissions vehicles that emit only water and heat. As compared with internal combustion vehicles, hydrogen vehicles centralize pollutants at the site of the hydrogen production, where hydrogen is typically derived from reformed natural gas. Transporting and storing hydrogen may also create pollutants.",
            "Hydrogen highway (Japan)\nJapan's hydrogen highway is a network of hydrogen filling stations placed along roadsides that provide fuel for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (HFCV). An HFCV is a vehicle that uses a fuel cell to convert hydrogen energy into electrical energy. The hydrogen that is used in fuel cell vehicles can be made using fossil or renewable resources. The hydrogen highway is necessary for HFCVs to be used. HFCV reduce tailpipe emissions of greenhouse gases. By May 2016, there were approximately 80 hydrogen fueling stations in Japan.",
            "BMW Hydrogen 7\nThe BMW Hydrogen 7 is a limited production hydrogen internal combustion engine vehicle built from 2005-2007 by German automobile manufacturer BMW. The car is based on BMW\u2019s traditional gasoline-powered BMW 7 Series (E65) line of vehicles, and more specifically the 760Li. It uses the same 6 litre V-12 motor as does the 760i and 760Li; however, it has been modified to also allow for the combustion of hydrogen as well as gasoline, making it a bivalent engine. Unlike many other current hydrogen powered vehicles like those being produced by Honda, General Motors, and Daimler AG - which use fuel cell technology and hydrogen to produce electricity to power the vehicle - the BMW Hydrogen 7 burns the hydrogen in an internal combustion engine.",
            "Hydrogen vehicle\nA hydrogen vehicle is a vehicle that uses hydrogen as its onboard fuel for motive power. Hydrogen vehicles include hydrogen fueled space rockets, as well as automobiles and other transportation vehicles. The power plants of such vehicles convert the chemical energy of hydrogen to mechanical energy either by burning hydrogen in an internal combustion engine, or by reacting hydrogen with oxygen in a fuel cell to run electric motors. Widespread use of hydrogen for fueling transportation is a key element of a proposed hydrogen economy.",
            "United States hydrogen policy\nThe principle of a fuel cell was discovered by Christian Friedrich Sch\u00f6nbein in 1838, and the first fuel cell was constructed by Sir William Robert Grove in 1839. The fuel cells made at this time were most similar to today's phosphoric acid fuel cells. Most hydrogen fuel cells today are of the proton exchange membrane (PEM) type. A PEM converts the chemical energy released during the electrochemical reaction of hydrogen and oxygen into electrical energy. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 was the first national legislation that called for large-scale hydrogen research. A five-year program was conducted that investigated the production of hydrogen from renewable energy sources and the feasibility of existing natural gas pipelines to carry hydrogen. It also called for the research into hydrogen storage systems for electric vehicles and the development of fuel cells suitable to power an electric motor vehicle.",
            "Flexible-fuel vehicle\nA flexible-fuel vehicle (FFV) or dual-fuel vehicle (colloquially called a flex-fuel vehicle) is an alternative fuel vehicle with an internal combustion engine designed to run on more than one fuel, usually gasoline blended with either ethanol or methanol fuel, and both fuels are stored in the same common tank. Modern flex-fuel engines are capable of burning any proportion of the resulting blend in the combustion chamber as fuel injection and spark timing are adjusted automatically according to the actual blend detected by a fuel composition sensor. Flex-fuel vehicles are distinguished from bi-fuel vehicles, where two fuels are stored in separate tanks and the engine runs on one fuel at a time, for example, compressed natural gas (CNG), liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), or hydrogen.",
