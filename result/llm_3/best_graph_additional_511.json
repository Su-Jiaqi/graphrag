Featuring films by women, for women, and of women, the 1st edition of SEOUL International Film Festival received a number of positive reviews from the audience, which was never anticipated this much. Thanks to continuous support from the audience, SEOUL International Film Festival that used to be happening every other year has become an annual event since the 3rd edition in 2001. For the 6th edition in 2004, SEOUL International Women\u2019s Film Festival looked for changes by relocating the festival office and venues to Sinchon, the street of youth and culture. For the 9th edition in 2007, the Queer Rainbow section was first introduced, presenting films about life and culture of gender minorities. In order to go beyond the gender boundaries based on biological sex and to reach out for solidarity, SEOUL International Women\u2019s Film Festival newly created the Open Cinema section encompassing feminist films made by male directors. Now in 2015, SEOUL International Film Festival attempts to build its new festival identity and become a cultural platform more approachable for a wide variety of audiences by changing the official English title of the festival from International Women\u2019s Film Festival in Seoul to SEOUL International Women\u2019s Film Festival as well as by retouching the festival logo used for last 17 years.",

Featuring films by women, for women, and of women, the 1st edition of SEOUL International Film Festival received a number of positive reviews from the audience, which was never anticipated this much.
