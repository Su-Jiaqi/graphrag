The American horror film was properly created in the 1930s, most notably the Universal Horror film productions. \"White Zombie\" is considered to be the first feature length zombie film and has been described as the archetype and model of all zombie movies. A number of Hollywood actors made a name for themselves in horror films of this decade, in particular Bela Lugosi (\"Dracula\", 1931) and Boris Karloff (\"Frankenstein\", 1931). Fredric March won an Academy Award for Best Actor in \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\", 1931. Films of this era frequently took their inspiration from the literature of gothic horror and more often dealt with themes of science versus religion rather than supernatural themes."
