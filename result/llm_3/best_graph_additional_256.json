            "Temperate forest\nTemperate forests correspond to forest concentration formed in the northern and southern hemisphere, or in temperate regions. It is the same as a tropical forest except for the climate and some of the animals adaptations. Main characteristics include: wide leaves, large and tall trees, large wild canopy and non seasonal vegetation. Temperate forests can be further distinguished by weather patterns and geographical features that favor the predominance of certain kinds of trees. In temperate coniferous forests, evergreen conifers predominate, while in temperate broadleaf and mixed forests, a more even distribution exists between evergreen trees and deciduous trees. Temperate deciduous forests, a subgroup of temperate broadleaf forests, consist of trees that lose their leaves every year. Finally, temperate rainforests typically have heavy rainfall and dense humidity. But in some temperate forests there are just trees with needles and do not shed their leaves during the winter, so the climate is a little different and not as cold. They are also known as montane forests.",

In most temperate coniferous forests, evergreen conifers predominate, while some are a mix of conifers and broadleaf evergreen trees and/or broadleaf deciduous trees. Temperate evergreen forests are common in the coastal areas of regions that have mild winters and heavy rainfall, or inland in drier climates or mountain areas. Temperate coniferous forests are only found in the Northern Hemisphere in North America, Europe, and Asia. A separate ecoregion, the tropical coniferous forests, occurs in more tropical climates.",
            "Separately managed account\nA separately managed account (SMA) is a term within the investment management industry encompassing several different types of investment accounts. For example, an SMA often is used to refer to an individual managed investment account often offered by a brokerage firm through one of their brokers or financial consultants and managed by independent investment management firms (often called money managers for short) and have varying fee structures. These particular types of SMAs may be called \"wrap fee\" or \"dual contract\" accounts, depending on their structure. There is no official designation for the SMA, but there are common characteristics that are represented in many types of SMA programs. These characteristics include an open structure or flexible investment security choices; multiple money managers; and a customized investment portfolio formulated for a client's specific investment objectives or desired restrictions.",

            "Moose\nThe moose (North America) or elk (Eurasia), \"Alces alces\", is the largest extant species in the deer family. Moose are distinguished by the broad, flat (or \"palmate\") antlers of the males; other members of the family have antlers with a dendritic (\"twig-like\") configuration. Moose typically inhabit boreal forests and temperate broadleaf and mixed forests of the Northern Hemisphere in temperate to subarctic climates. Hunting and other human activities have caused a reduction in the size of the moose's range over time. Moose have been reintroduced to some of their former habitats. Currently, most moose are found in Canada, Alaska, New England, Fennoscandia, Baltic States, and Russia. Their diet consists of both terrestrial and aquatic vegetation. The most common moose predators are the gray wolf along with bears and humans. Unlike most other deer species, moose are solitary animals and do not form herds. Although generally slow-moving and sedentary, moose can become aggressive and move quickly if angered or startled. Their mating season in the autumn features energetic fights between males competing for a female.",

This genus was considered to have 250 species until Peter Taylor reduced the number to 214 in his exhaustive study, \"The genus Utricularia - a taxonomic monograph\", published by HMSO (1989). Taylor's classification is generally accepted, though his division of the genus in two subgenera was soon seen as obsolete. Molecular genetic studies have mostly confirmed Taylor's sections with some modifications (Jobson et al., 2003), but reinstalled the division of the genus in three subgenera.
