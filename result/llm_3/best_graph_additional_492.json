            "Fratricide Punished\nFratricide Punished, or \"The Tragedy of Fratricide Punished: or Prince Hamlet of Denmark\", is the English name of a German-language play of anonymous origins and disputed age. Due to similarities of plot and dramatis personae, it is considered to be a German variant of the English play \"Hamlet\", though possibly not William Shakespeare\u2019s \"Hamlet\", and is a problematic figure in discussions of Hamlet Q1 and the so-called Ur-Hamlet. Such discussions have helped to raise interest in the text, which primarily lived in obscurity before the discovery of Q1 in 1823. \"Fratricide Punished\" was first published in German from a written manuscript in 1781 and translated to English by Georgina Archer in 1865. Though the play is readily available online both in English and in German, the manuscript has been lost since its initial publication, and all subsequent editions of the text are, as such, at a remove from the original. \"Fratricide Punished\" is often referred to by its German title \"Der Bestrafte Brudermord,\" or \"Tragoedia der bestrafte Bruder-mord oder: Prinz Hamlet aus D\u00e4nnemark.\"",

The conventional wisdom has the name \u2018palouse\u2019 being derived from the French term for the large treeless plain region in eastern Washington stretching into Idaho: the Palouse, a word meaning grassy spot or place. However, Boone says that the name could originate from the name of a major village of Palouse Indians, Palus, located at the confluence of the Palouse and Snake Rivers. 'Palus' is the Sachapin Indian word for \u201csomething sticking down in the water,\u201d in this case the something was a large rock, thought to be a beaver\u2019s heart, and which had an important religious significance for the Palouse Indians. The Palouse National Forest had its administrative headquarters in the town of Wallace, Idaho for its 15-month existence and was administered by the U.S. Forest Service with 194404 acre . With the issuance of Executive Order 843 by President Roosevelt on June 26, 1908, with an effective date of July 1, 1908, the entire forest was absorbed by the Coeur d'Alene National Forest and the area ceased to be an independently administered national forest. The lands of the former Palouse National Forest were then administered as part of the Coeur d\u2019Alene National Forest for three years before being combined with other lands to establish the St. Joe National Forest on July 1, 1911. The area of the former Palouse National Forest formed the western portion of the St. Joe National Forest. Once transferred in 1911, the area of the Palouse National Forest became the Palouse Ranger District of the St. Joe National Forest and is still considered part of the St. Joe National Forest.

            "Etham\nEtham (Hebrew: \u05d0\u05b5\u05ea\u05b8\u05dd\u200e \u200e , meaning \"solid, enduring\") was the second place, after Succoth, at which the Israelites stopped during the Exodus. According to the Torah, Etham was on the edge of the wilderness (i.e. the edge of civilization or the edge of cultivated land) and marked the start of their Wilderness journey along a route which avoided entering the land of the Philistines, 'lest perhaps the people change their minds when they see war, and return to Egypt'. It has been suggested that Etham is another name for Khetam (\"fortress\"), located on the great wall of Egypt, which extended from the Mediterranean Sea to the Gulf of Suez. It may be close to the modern town of Isma\u00eflia.",

            "Nantahala National Forest\nThe Nantahala National Forest, established in 1920, is a national forest located in the American state of North Carolina. The word \"Nantahala\" is a Cherokee word meaning \"Land of the Noonday Sun.\" The name is appropriate as, in some spots, the sun only reaches the floors of the deep gorges of the forest when high overhead at midday.

            "Palouse National Forest\nThe Palouse Forest Reserve and after March 4, 1907, the Palouse National Forest was established by Presidential Proclamation (34 U.S. Statutes at Large 3293) on March 2, 1907 and was one of President Theodore Roosevelt's Midnight forests, created before the federal law banning new forest reserves in six western states, including Idaho, became effective. The conventional wisdom has the name \u2018palouse\u2019 being derived from the French term for the large treeless plain region in eastern Washington stretching into Idaho: the Palouse, a word meaning grassy spot or place. However, Boone says that the name could originate from the name of a major village of Palouse Indians, Palus, located at the confluence of the Palouse and Snake Rivers. 'Palus' is the Sachapin Indian word for \u201csomething sticking down in the water,\u201d in this case the something was a large rock, thought to be a beaver\u2019s heart, and which had an important religious significance for the Palouse Indians. The Palouse National Forest had its administrative headquarters in the town of Wallace, Idaho for its 15-month existence and was administered by the U.S. Forest Service with 194404 acre . With the issuance of Executive Order 843 by President Roosevelt on June 26, 1908, with an effective date of July 1, 1908, the entire forest was absorbed by the Coeur d'Alene National Forest and the area ceased to be an independently administered national forest. The lands of the former Palouse National Forest were then administered as part of the Coeur d\u2019Alene National Forest for three years before being combined with other lands to establish the St. Joe National Forest on July 1, 1911. The area of the former Palouse National Forest formed the western portion of the St. Joe National Forest. Once transferred in 1911, the area of the Palouse National Forest became the Palouse Ranger District of the St. Joe National Forest and is still considered part of the St. Joe National Forest. However, it has been administered by the Clearwater National Forest since the 1973 administrative merger of the Kaniksu National Forest, Coeur d\u2019Alene, and St. Joe National Forests into the Idaho Panhandle National Forests.",

            "Fratricide Punished\nFratricide Punished, or \"The Tragedy of Fratricide Punished: or Prince Hamlet of Denmark\", is the English name of a German-language play of anonymous origins and disputed age. Due to similarities of plot and dramatis personae, it is considered to be a German variant of the English play \"Hamlet\", though possibly not William Shakespeare\u2019s \"Hamlet\", and is a problematic figure in discussions of Hamlet Q1 and the so-called Ur-Hamlet. Such discussions have helped to raise interest in the text, which primarily lived in obscurity before the discovery of Q1 in 1823. \"Fratricide Punished\" was first published in German from a written manuscript in 1781 and translated to English by Georgina Archer in 1865. Though the play is readily available online both in English and in German, the manuscript has been lost since its initial publication, and all subsequent editions of the text are, as such, at a remove from the original. \"Fratricide Punished\" is often referred to by its German title \"Der Bestrafte Brudermord,\" or \"Tragoedia der bestrafte Bruder-mord oder: Prinz Hamlet aus D\u00e4nnemark.\"",

            "Temperate coniferous forest\nTemperate coniferous forest is a terrestrial biome found in temperate regions of the world with warm summers and cool winters and adequate rainfall to sustain a forest. In most temperate coniferous forests, evergreen conifers predominate, while some are a mix of conifers and broadleaf evergreen trees and/or broadleaf deciduous trees. Temperate evergreen forests are common in the coastal areas of regions that have mild winters and heavy rainfall, or inland in drier climates or mountain areas. Temperate coniferous forests are only found in the Northern Hemisphere in North America, Europe, and Asia. A separate ecoregion, the tropical coniferous forests, occurs in more tropical climates."
