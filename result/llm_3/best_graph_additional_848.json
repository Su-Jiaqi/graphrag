            "French destroyer Lynx\nThe French destroyer \"Lynx\" was a \"Chacal\"-class destroyer (\"contre-torpilleur\") built for the French Navy during the 1920s. The \"Chacal\"s were regarded as obsolete by 1935 and \"Lynx\" became a training ship for the torpedo school at Toulon that year. She was assigned convoy escort duties in the Atlantic after the start of World War II in September 1939. In July 1940, the ship was present when the British attacked the French ships at Mers-el-K\u00e9bir, but managed to escape without damage. After she reached Toulon, \"Lynx\" was placed in reserve where she remained for the next two years. On 27 November 1942, she was scuttled at Toulon when the Germans attempted to capture the French ships there. Her wreck was salvaged in 1944, but she was not broken up until 1948."
