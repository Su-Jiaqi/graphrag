This can be seen through the success of bands like Pure Prairie League and their album \"Bustin' Out\" in 1972, as well as the mainstream success of Ben Folds Five in the alternative rock scene in the 1990s. Additionally, Sheryl Crow's single \"Light in Your Eyes\" from 2003 and Steve Perry's album \"For the Love of Strange Medicine\" from 1994 also received significant airplay on radio stations. Therefore, the dominance of soft rock in Pakistan can be observed throughout the decades, with a particular peak in the 1970s.

Their single \"Ghalti Mein Shta\" released in 2014 also gained significant airplay.\n\nThe dominance of soft rock in Pakistan can be traced back to the 1970s, as the genre smoothed over the edges of singer-songwriter and pop music, relying on simple, melodic songs with big, lush productions. This style of music dominated radio throughout the 1970s, which aligns with the rise of Naseer & Shahab in the early 2010s.\n\nThe Pashtun diaspora in Pakistan, which is home to the largest Pashtun community, has also contributed to the popularity of Pashtu language music, including soft alternative rock. This demographic has likely played a role in the radio airplay trends of Naseer & Shahab's music.\n\nOverall, the dominance of soft alternative rock in Pakistan, particularly in the Pashtu language, aligns with the rise of Naseer & Shahab in the early 2010s, and it can be linked to the historical trends of soft rock music dominating radio airplay in the 1970s.",
