Casey, 505 U.S. 833 (1992) , was a landmark United States Supreme Court case in which the constitutionality of several Pennsylvania state statutory provisions regarding abortion was challenged. The Court's plurality opinion reaffirmed the central holding of \"Roe v. Wade\" stating that \"matters, involving the most intimate and personal choices a person may make in a lifetime, choices central to personal dignity and autonomy, are central to the liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.\" The Court's plurality opinion upheld the constitutional right to have an abortion while altering the standard for analyzing restrictions on that right, crafting the \"undue burden\" standard for abortion restrictions. \"Planned Parenthood v. Casey\" differs from \"Roe,\" however, because under \"Roe\" the state could not regulate abortions in the first trimester whereas under \"Planned Parenthood v. Casey\" the state can regulate abortions in the first trimester, or any point before the point of viability, and beyond as long as that regulation does not pose an undue burden on women's fundamental right to an abortion. Applying this new standard of review, the Court upheld four regulations and invalidated the requirement of spousal notification.",

Under \"Miranda v. Arizona\", evidence obtained by police during interrogation of a suspect before he has been read his Miranda rights is inadmissible. Here, however, the defendant had been indicted in court, and thus his Sixth Amendment right to counsel had automatically attached. At issue was whether a voluntary admission of incriminating facts in response to police statements constituted a waiver of this right to counsel.",

Freind (born 1944) is a Republican politician who served in the Pennsylvania General Assembly as the state representative for Delaware County from 1976 until 1993, when he unsuccessfully challenged Arlen Specter in the 1992 Republican primary election. He was most notable for authoring a law that was presented as a tort reform measure but was actually designed to restrict abortion rights, that included \"requirements that a married woman notify her husband, that there be a 24-hour wait before any abortion, and that doctors show patients a pamphlet with pictures of developing fetuses\".
