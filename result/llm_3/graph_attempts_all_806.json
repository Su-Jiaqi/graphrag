            "The reintroduction of piston power in aviation can be attributed to several factors. One reason is the better fuel economy offered by piston engines, as seen in the Orenda OE600 engine. This makes them attractive for older aircraft whose engines are reaching the end of their lifespan. Additionally, the use of contra-rotating propellers, which apply the maximum power of a single piston or turboprop engine to drive two coaxial propellers in contra-rotation, has also contributed to the reintroduction of piston power in aviation.\n\nFurthermore, the North American NA-16, the first trainer aircraft built by North American Aviation, and its line of closely related trainer aircraft, may have played a role in the reintroduction of piston power in aviation. Additionally, the need for strategic resources during World War II, as seen in Operation Dragoon, may have led to a reconsideration of the use of piston power in aviation.\n\nLastly, advancements in technology, such as Advanced Distribution Automation (ADA) in the electrical power grid, may have influenced the reintroduction of piston power in aviation. The extension of intelligent control over electrical power grid functions to the distribution level and beyond, as well as the increasing control over distribution-level equipment, may have contributed to the reintroduction of piston power in aviation.",
            "Piston engines offer several advantages compared to turboprop engines.

Additionally, piston engines are known for their reliability and lower maintenance costs compared to turboprop engines. They also have a simpler design, which can lead to easier maintenance and repairs. Another advantage is that piston engines can be used in bi-fuel vehicles, allowing for the use of alternative fuels such as natural gas, LPG, or hydrogen. Overall, piston engines offer a cost-effective and versatile option for aircraft and vehicles.",

            "There are several specific reasons or contexts for replacing the PT6 turboprop engine with a piston engine. Some of these reasons may include:\n\n1. Cost: Turboprop engines are generally more expensive to purchase and maintain compared to piston engines. In some cases, the cost of operating and maintaining a PT6 engine may be prohibitive for certain aircraft operators, leading them to consider replacing it with a more cost-effective piston engine.\n\n2. Fuel Efficiency: While turboprop engines are known for their fuel efficiency, some aircraft operators may find that piston engines offer comparable fuel efficiency at a lower operating cost. This may be a driving factor in the decision to replace a PT6 engine with a piston engine.\n\n3. Maintenance and Overhaul: Turboprop engines typically require more frequent and costly maintenance and overhaul compared to piston engines. If an aircraft operator is looking to reduce maintenance costs and downtime, they may opt to replace a PT6 engine with a piston engine that requires less frequent and less expensive maintenance.\n\n4. Aircraft Performance: In some cases, aircraft operators may find that a piston engine offers sufficient performance for their specific needs, making the switch from a PT6 engine a viable option. This could be particularly relevant for aircraft operating in shorter range or lower altitude missions where the performance advantages of a turboprop engine may not be as critical.\n\n5. Regulatory Compliance: Changes in aviation regulations or emissions standards may also drive the decision to replace a PT6 engine with a piston engine. If a piston engine meets the required regulatory standards and offers a more cost-effective and efficient solution, it may be a preferred option for some aircraft operators.\n\nOverall, the specific reasons for replacing a PT6 turboprop engine with a piston engine will depend on the unique operational and financial considerations of the aircraft operator, as well as any changes in regulatory requirements or industry standards.",

            "Ford flathead V8 engine\nThe Ford flathead V8 (often called simply the Ford flathead, flathead Ford, or flatty when the context is implicit, such as in hot-rodding) is a V8 engine of the valve-in-block type designed by the Ford Motor Company and built by Ford and various licensees. During the engine's first decade of production, when overhead-valve engines were rare, it was usually known simply as the Ford V\u20118, and the first car model in which it was installed, the Model 18, was (and still is) often called simply the \"Ford V\u20118\", after its new engine. Although the V8 configuration was not new when the Ford V8 was introduced in 1932, the latter was a market first in the respect that it made an 8-cylinder affordable and a V engine affordable to the emerging mass market consumer for the first time. It was the first independently designed and built V8 engine produced by Ford for mass production, and it ranks as one of the company's most important developments. A fascination with ever-more-powerful engines was perhaps the most salient aspect of the American car and truck market for a half century, from 1923 until 1973. The Ford flathead V8 was perfectly in tune with the cultural moment of its introduction, leading the way into a future of which the Ford company was a principal architect. Thus it became a phenomenal success. The engine design, with various changes but no major ones, was installed in Ford passenger cars and trucks until 1953, making the engine's 21-year production run for the U.S. consumer market longer than the 19-year run of the Ford Model T engine for that market. The engine was on Ward's list of the 10 best engines of the 20th century. It was a staple of hot rodders in the 1950s, and it remains famous in the classic car hobbies even today, despite the huge variety of other popular V8s that followed.",

            "Contra-rotating\nContra-rotating, also referred to as coaxial contra-rotating, is a technique whereby parts of a mechanism rotate in opposite directions about a common axis, usually to minimise the effect of torque. Examples include some aircraft propellers, resulting in the maximum power of a single piston or turboprop engine to drive two propellers in opposite rotation. Contra-rotating propellers are also common in some marine transmission systems, in particular for large speed boats with planing hulls. Two propellers are arranged one behind the other, and power is transferred from the engine via planetary gear transmission. The configuration can also be used in helicopter designs termed coaxial rotors, where similar issues and principles of torque apply.",

This equipment is used to photograph sampling sites, to actually take samples from the sites, and to process these samples. At each site throughout the world, samples are taken from the intertidal zone out to a depth of 10 meters (and optionally out to 20 meters depth). These samples are then processed (the organisms are isolated) and then analyzed and catalogued. The information (regarding the kind and number of organisms analyzed) is sent to the global headquarters of NaGISA- the University of Kyoto in Japan. All of this information is then collated on the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS website).

            "The reintroduction of piston power engines over the popular turboprop engine, such as the Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6, offers several potential benefits in terms of performance, cost, and other factors.\n\nPerformance: Piston engines can offer better fuel economy compared to turboprop engines, making them attractive for older aircraft with aging engines. This can result in cost savings for operators and potentially lower operating costs in the long run. Additionally, the use of contra-rotating propellers in piston-powered aircraft can help minimize the effect of torque, improving overall performance and stability.\n\nCost: The potential for better fuel economy with piston engines can lead to cost savings for operators, as fuel is a significant expense in aviation. Additionally, the initial cost of acquiring and maintaining piston-powered engines may be lower compared to turboprop engines, making them a more cost-effective option for some operators.\n\nOther factors: The reintroduction of piston power engines or the development of alternative propulsion systems, such as hydrogen-powered aircraft, demonstrates ongoing innovation and adaptation in the aviation industry. This can lead to advancements in technology, environmental sustainability, and potentially open up new opportunities for aircraft design and operation.\n\nIn conclusion, the reintroduction of piston power engines over the popular turboprop engine offers potential benefits in terms of performance, cost, and other factors. However, it is important to consider the specific needs and requirements of each aircraft and operator when evaluating the suitability of piston power versus turboprop engines."

MOM will also contain information which our society is obliged to forward to the future: e.g. description of nuclear waste repositories. MOM collaborates with the NEA and SKB. Although the most obvious ambition and often described in the media is the concern about preserving our knowledge, this is not the primary goal of MOM. Serving as a time capsule MOM is both: in a time frame of millennia it is the story about us, and in a time frame of decades it is a backup. In times where global warming, nuclear danger and biological warfare threaten the existence of civilization, saving the core knowledge and culture acquired over centuries is a backup measure. In case of a collapse, the MOM project could help survivors to rebuild civilization. Linked to this, an another reason is of political order: facing the lack of reactivity of authorities concerning global warming, the MOM project is a reminder of what can happen. Roman and Greek civilizations whose histories have been reconstructed by the small percentage of texts and artifacts which survived until our days are examples that have inspired the MOM project. Finally, it's a critic of our digital civilization : according to Kunze, maybe nothing of the 21st century will last in the future, since most of our interactions are now virtual.

He and his family were interned in Douglas on the Isle of Man during the Second World War. He began his career working for Filippo Del Giudice and Two Cities Films. When Two Cities was absorbed into the Rank Organisation in the mid-1940s Coen was employed by Sir David Cunynghame of London Film Productions as a subtitler. As Coen later described it in an interview, he did not know anything about subtitling at the time, and learned on the job: I finally got a phone call from London Films, Sir Cunnyngham, that 's it, who asked me whether I had ever subtitles pictures. I immediately said I had when in point of fact I did not know what he meant, and there was a young man in the office with Sir David Cunnynghame called Lew Watt, and he said Lew Watt will do the technical side and we want you to subtitle an Italian picture in to English. I said certainly . I came out of his office and Lew Watt said to me you don't know what they're talking about do you, I said you're quite right, he said well I'll show you. And I started subtitling pictures with Lew Watt, I used to do the literary side, and he used to do the technical side, the spotting, and lengths, and we together did subtitles for 40 or 50 pictures. The funny thing was we subtitled pictures in Chinese, in Indian and for the Chinese picture I had to have a Chinese waiter with me to tell me where the subtitles [...] I had the Italian dialogue and I had the picture, they gave me a film and we did the spotting together with Lew Watt and the measurements and I used to type the script. We had the film, we had the print which used to run on the two sided thing. And Lew Watt was working all the day so we had to do this at night, so we either used to work at night till 2 o'clock in the morning or we used to work at the weekends. There was always the problem that the Movieola might break down and so we had spare keys of other cutting rooms in in elm St in case we were caught. And that was how we started.Coen later founded his own company Kenilworth Film Productions and spent most of the post-war years producing second features.

This document is agreed to the first \"constitutional document\" in the Turkish history, because for the first time in Turkish history with Sened-i \u0130ttifak in Ottoman the state power is gotten limited. Imperial Edict of Reorganization prepared by Mustafa Reshid Pasha on November 3, 1839 in period of Abd\u00fclmecit was declared.

Hatt-\u0131 H\u00fcmayun that was complementary and reinforcing of this imperial edict was declared as \"edict\" in 1856 by Abd\u00fclmecit. Eggheads and writers growing up in the period of Tanzimat and known as The Young Ottomans began to defend constitutionalism government by being affected from Europe and they brought Abd\u00fclhamit II instead of him, by taking down Abd\u00fclaziz from throne in order to get constitutionalism declared. On December 23, 1876 it was passed to constitutionalism by being declared Kanun-i Esas\u00ee Mithat Pasha prepares. Kanun-i Esas\u00ee is amditted as a constitution according to criteria. In accordance with 113th article of Kanun-i Esas\u00ee that was the first constitution of Turkish history and consisting of 12 sections and 119 articles, the sovereign could suspend constitution on extraordinaries conditions. Abd\u00fclhamit II suspended constitution by showing why Russian wars in 1877. A result of the military insurrection in 1908, Abd\u00fclhamit II constituted the Constitution of 1876 again and so the period of Constitutionalism II began. it was made important changes on constitution in 1909 after Abd\u00fclhamit II taken down from throne after in 1909 31 March Incident happened.

It was the first independently designed and built V8 engine produced by Ford for mass production, and it ranks as one of the company's most important developments. A fascination with ever-more-powerful engines was perhaps the most salient aspect of the American car and truck market for a half century, from 1923 until 1973. The Ford flathead V8 was perfectly in tune with the cultural moment of its introduction, leading the way into a future of which the Ford company was a principal architect. Thus it became a phenomenal success. The engine design, with various changes but no major ones, was installed in Ford passenger cars and trucks until 1953, making the engine's 21-year production run for the U.S. consumer market longer than the 19-year run of the Ford Model T engine for that market.

            "Postpipe\nIn archaeology, a postpipe (or post pipe) is the remains of an upright timber placed in a posthole. Given the right conditions, timbers may survive over long periods of time and a recovered postpipe can simply be of solid wood. Under less preservative conditions however, only a dark circular stain of organic material may be left in the fill of the posthole observable in plan and section. This differs in consistency from the less organic backfill of the posthole and can be identified simply through this change in make-up. The size and depth and of the postpipe can provide information as to any reuse of the posthole especially if several different postpipes can be identified. They can also indicate the species of wood used and help suggest the nature of the structure that the timber once supported. The term was first used by Maud Cunnington when she excavated the site of Woodhenge in the English county of Wiltshire during the 1920s and found numerous examples of decomposed timber posts.",

            "Memory of Mankind\nSeveral motivations underlie the project. The primary ambition of MOM is to preserve an image of our era, created by numerous participants all over the planet. MOM will also contain information which our society is obliged to forward to the future: e.g. description of nuclear waste repositories. MOM collaborates with the NEA and SKB. Although the most obvious ambition and often described in the media is the concern about preserving our knowledge, this is not the primary goal of MOM. Serving as a time capsule MOM is both: in a time frame of millennia it is the story about us, and in a time frame of decades it is a backup. In times where global warming, nuclear danger and biological warfare threaten the existence of civilization, saving the core knowledge and culture acquired over centuries is a backup measure. In case of a collapse, the MOM project could help survivors to rebuild civilization. Linked to this, an another reason is of political order: facing the lack of reactivity of authorities concerning global warming, the MOM project is a reminder of what can happen. Roman and Greek civilizations whose histories have been reconstructed by the small percentage of texts and artifacts which survived until our days are examples that have inspired the MOM project. Finally, it's a critic of our digital civilization : according to Kunze, maybe nothing of the 21st century will last in the future, since most of our interactions are now virtual. The \"accuracy versus bullshit\" is one of the main themes of the MOM project, worried about loss of information, the project can only aim to save a fragment of the information produced until today, but this fragment has to be representative.",

            "Sharon Gannon\nSharon Gannon (born July 4, 1951 in Washington, D.C.) is a yoga teacher, animal rights advocate, musician, author, dancer/choreographer and painter. Along with David Life, she is the co-founder of the Jivamukti Yoga Method which contributed to the exponential rise in popularity of yoga in the west during the late 20th century. The Jivamukti Yoga Method distinguishes itself as a path to enlightenment by promoting compassion for all beings, challenging the modern belief that enslaving and exploiting animals and the natural world is our right as the dominant species. The Jivamukti Yoga Method teaches its students that they must be willing to promote the happiness of all beings without exception if they wish to realize their fullest capacity for joy. Jivamukti students are encouraged to adopt a diet that eliminates all animal products (vegan) as this is the diet that causes the least amount of harm to the earth and other beings, humans included. Core to the teachings of Jivamukti Yoga is the concept of shunyata or (emptiness) which is found in the ancient yogic scriptures. This idea can be simply stated as: everything you see and experience in the world comes from your perception of it. If you want to change someone or to change the world, you start by changing yourself by changing your views. When you begin to embrace this concept and put it into practice then you cannot find solace in complaining or blaming others. You are freed from seeing yourself as a victim of others or of circumstances. According to Gannon: \"How you treat others will determine how others treat you. How others treat you will determine how you see yourself. How you see yourself will determine who you are.\"",

Node 3 focuses on understanding the broader benefits of piston power versus turboprop engines, providing a context for the analysis. Node 4 builds on Nodes 1 and 2 by finding real-world examples of the replacement, setting the stage for the final comparison. The process culminates in Node 5, where the gathered data is synthesized to articulate the benefits of this technological shift, comparing the piston power benefits with the previously dominant turboprop engine."

            "Polyphase system\nA polyphase system is a means of distributing alternating-current electrical power. Polyphase systems have three or more energized electrical conductors carrying alternating currents with a definite time offset between the voltage waves in each conductor. Polyphase systems are particularly useful for transmitting power to electric motors. The most common example is the three-phase power system used for industrial applications and for power transmission. A major advantage of three phase power transmission (using three conductors, as opposed to a single phase power transmission, which uses two conductors), is that, since the remaining conductors act as the return path for any single conductor, the power transmitted by a balanced three phase system is three times that of a single phase transmission but only one extra conductor is used. Thus, a 50% / 1.5x increase in the transmission costs achieves a 200% / 3.0x increase in the power transmitted.",

            "Contra-rotating\nContra-rotating, also referred to as coaxial contra-rotating, is a technique whereby parts of a mechanism rotate in opposite directions about a common axis, usually to minimise the effect of torque. Examples include some aircraft propellers, resulting in the maximum power of a single piston or turboprop engine to drive two propellers in opposite rotation. Contra-rotating propellers are also common in some marine transmission systems, in particular for large speed boats with planing hulls. Two propellers are arranged one behind the other, and power is transferred from the engine via planetary gear transmission. The configuration can also be used in helicopter designs termed coaxial rotors, where similar issues and principles of torque apply.",

So named for the Japanese word \"nagisa\" (\"where the land meets the sea\"), it is an Apronym. NaGISA is the first project of the larger CoML effort (Census of Marine Life) to have global participation in actual field work. The actual procedures of this project involve inexpensive collection equipment (for easy universal participation). This equipment is used to photograph sampling sites, to actually take samples from the sites, and to process these samples. At each site throughout the world, samples are taken from the intertidal zone out to a depth of 10 meters (and optionally out to 20 meters depth). These samples are then processed (the organisms are isolated) and then analyzed and catalogued. The information (regarding the kind and number of organisms analyzed) is sent to the global headquarters of NaGISA- the University of Kyoto in Japan. All of this information is then collated on the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS website). The end goal of the larger CoML effort is to find what \"was\", what \"is\", and what \"will be\" in the world's oceans. For NaGISA the goal is to find this in the world's in-shore areas.",
