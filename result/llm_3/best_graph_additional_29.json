There was also a general store located in the commercial space on the main floor. Because medical care in a hospital was new in the community, it did not succeed and it folded in 1905.

It was more successful as a hospital the second time, and it was acquired by the city for a community hospital in 1920. After a new hospital building was constructed in 1951, the Good Samaritan Society bought the building for a nursing home. By 1973 changes in state law no longer made operating a nursing home here feasible.
