It was a military conflict that took place between 1630 and 1635, during the course of the Thirty Years' War. It was a major turning point of the war, as during this time, the Protestant cause, previously on the verge of defeat, won several major victories and snatched victory away from the Habsburg-Catholic coalition.

He was a member of the Oakland Athletics teams that won three World Series in a row (1972\u201374).

The first invasion, in late summer, was unsuccessful, gaining the Romans little else besides a beachhead on the coast of Kent. The second invasion achieved more: the Romans installed a king, Mandubracius, who was friendly to Rome, and they forced the submission of Mandubracius's rival, Cassivellaunus. No territory was conquered and held for Rome; instead, all Roman-occupied territory was restored to the allied Trinovantes, along with the promised tribute of the other tribes in what is now eastern England.",

            "Lotion play\nLotion Play is a subset of the better known Wet-And-Messy fetish (WAM), which typically involves participants using food (such as pudding or whipped cream), mud, or paint as a lubricant to facilitate sexual activity. Lotion Play isolates lotion specifically as a lubricating medium - setting it apart in the Wet-and-Messy genre, as other common WAM mediums do not have such specific popularity as Lotion Play. Lotion Play (\u30ed\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4 , r\u014dshon purei ) , also known as gookkake, gluekkake, is a popular fetish, form of Japanese erotica and prostitution request involving the use of copious amounts of lubricant, which in the Japanese language is referred to by the Old-French word \"lotion\" (\u30ed\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3 in Japanese).Typically lotion play involves a participant rubbing lotion on another using their body, sexual intercourse in a pool or bath filled with lotion, or lotion being poured over the participants during sex. In Japan (and other parts of the world), lotion is available in concentrated form (e.g.: liter/gallon) which can be added to hot water to produce the desired amount of lotion. A 1-gallon concentrate will typically yield 6-10 gallons of lotion (J-Lube Lotion Concentrate). The main component in most lotion is polyacrylate. A similar effect can be achieved by dissolving powdered methyl cellulose in water.",
            "Sharon Gannon\nSharon Gannon (born July 4, 1951 in Washington, D.C.) is a yoga teacher, animal rights advocate, musician, author, dancer/choreographer and painter. Along with David Life, she is the co-founder of the Jivamukti Yoga Method which contributed to the exponential rise in popularity of yoga in the west during the late 20th century. The Jivamukti Yoga Method distinguishes itself as a path to enlightenment by promoting compassion for all beings, challenging the modern belief that enslaving and exploiting animals and the natural world is our right as the dominant species. The Jivamukti Yoga Method teaches its students that they must be willing to promote the happiness of all beings without exception if they wish to realize their fullest capacity for joy. Jivamukti students are encouraged to adopt a diet that eliminates all animal products (vegan) as this is the diet that causes the least amount of harm to the earth and other beings, humans included. Core to the teachings of Jivamukti Yoga is the concept of shunyata or (emptiness) which is found in the ancient yogic scriptures. This idea can be simply stated as: everything you see and experience in the world comes from your perception of it. If you want to change someone or to change the world, you start by changing yourself by changing your views. When you begin to embrace this concept and put it into practice then you cannot find solace in complaining or blaming others. You are freed from seeing yourself as a victim of others or of circumstances. According to Gannon: \"How you treat others will determine how others treat you. How others treat you will determine how you see yourself. How you see yourself will determine who you are.\"",

Sanheyuan have structures on three sides of a courtyard, forming an inverted U-shape, resembling the Chinese character \u51f9 (pinyin: \"\u0101o\"). There is normally a wall linking the two forward-thrusting side wings, called \u5ec2\u623f (pinyin: \"xi\u0101ngf\u00e1ng\"), similar to the wings of a siheyuan. Sanheyuan may be square or rectangular shaped and can be single or multiple-story structures. Typically there are three structural divisions within the horizontal building in the U, which is called a \"three-jian\" building (Chinese: \u4e09\u9593\u5c4b; pinyin: \"s\u0101nji\u0101nw\u016b\"). The purpose of this main building varies by region, but typically consists of a central room serving ceremonial needs flanked on either side by a bedroom. The two wings making up the arms of the U may be long or short, according to need, and provide room for kitchens, toilets, storage, and additional bedrooms. In Taiwan, the wings of the sanheyuan are called \"protecting dragons\" (Chinese: \u8b77\u9f8d; pinyin: \"h\u00f9l\u00f3ng\"). Additional \"hulong\" would typically be added in pairs, placed parallel to the first set and then duplicated as the household grew. The inner pair of \"hulong\" were traditionally called \"inner protectors\" (Chinese: \u5167\u8b77; pinyin: \"n\u00e8ih\u00f9\"), the second pair \"outer protectors\" (Chinese: \u5916\u8b77; pinyin: \"w\u00e0ih\u00f9\"), and so on.",

There is no official designation for the SMA, but there are common characteristics that are represented in many types of SMA programs. These characteristics include an open structure or flexible investment security choices; multiple money managers; and a customized investment portfolio formulated for a client's specific investment objectives or desired restrictions.",

            "Gaseous fission reactor\nA gas nuclear reactor (or \"gas fueled reactor\") is a proposed kind of nuclear reactor in which the nuclear fuel would be in a gaseous state rather than liquid or solid. In this type of reactor, the only temperature-limiting materials would be the reactor walls. Conventional reactors have stricter limitations because the core would melt if the fuel temperature were to rise too high. It may also be possible to confine gaseous fission fuel magnetically, electrostatically or electrodynamically so that it would not touch (and melt) the reactor walls. A potential benefit of the gaseous reactor core concept is that instead of relying on the traditional Rankine or Brayton conversion cycles, it may be possible to extract electricity magnetohydrodynamically, or with simple direct electrostatic conversion of the charged particles.",

The organization is grouped by areas of speciality within different functional areas (e.g., finance, marketing, and engineering). Some refer to a functional area as a \"silo\". Besides the heads of a firm's product and/or geographic units the company's top management team typically consists of several functional heads such as the chief financial officer, the chief operating officer, and the chief strategy officer. Communication generally occurs within a single department. If information or project work is needed from another department, a request is transmitted up to the department head, who communicates the request to the other department head. Otherwise, communication stays within the department. Team members complete project work in addition to normal department work.",
            "Tax code (PAYE)\nIn the UK, every person paid under the PAYE scheme is allocated a tax code by HM Revenue and Customs. This is usually in the form of a number followed by a letter suffix, though other 'non-standard' codes are also used. This code describes to employers how much tax to deduct from an employee. The code is normally based on information provided to HMRC by the taxpayer or their employer. Tax codes are usually adjusted once a year to take into account any changes made in the National Budget, but can be altered more often to reflect an employee's circumstances. Tax codes can be changed if someone has paid too much or too little tax the previous tax year, if an employee receives state benefits, or has non-PAYE income (for example, self-employed earnings). Changes in a tax code are to ensure the employee has paid the correct amount of tax by the end of each tax year.",

This treaty was necessary, because neither the Republic of China nor the People's Republic of China was invited to sign the Treaty of San Francisco due to disagreements by other countries as to which government was the legitimate government of China during and after the Chinese Civil War. Under pressure from the United States, Japan signed a separate peace treaty with the Republic of China to bring the war between the two states to a formal end with a victory for the ROC. Although the ROC itself was not a participant in the San Francisco Peace Conference due to the resumption of the Chinese Civil War after 1945, this treaty largely corresponds to that of San Francisco.

This treaty was necessary, because neither the Republic of China nor the People's Republic of China was invited to sign the Treaty of San Francisco due to disagreements by other countries as to which government was the legitimate government of China during and after the Chinese Civil War. Under pressure from the United States, Japan signed a separate peace treaty with the Republic of China to bring the war between the two states to a formal end with a victory for the ROC. Although the ROC itself was not a participant in the San Francisco Peace Conference due to the resumption of the Chinese Civil War after 1945, this treaty largely corresponds to that of San Francisco.

At each site throughout the world, samples are taken from the intertidal zone out to a depth of 10 meters (and optionally out to 20 meters depth). These samples are then processed (the organisms are isolated) and then analyzed and catalogued. The information (regarding the kind and number of organisms analyzed) is sent to the global headquarters of NaGISA- the University of Kyoto in Japan.

The Welsh greatly disliked the \"gratuitously cruel\" Normans and by 1101 had regained control of the greater part of their country under the long reign of King Gruffudd ap Cynan, who had been imprisoned by the Normans for twelve years before his escape.

Magnus went on to take the Orkney Islands, the Hebrides, and the Isle of Man, islands north of Wales and west and north of Scotland and England, in 1098.",
