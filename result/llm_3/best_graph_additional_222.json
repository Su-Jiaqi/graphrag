The 1981 follow-up, \"Killers\", was written almost entirely by the bassist, with frontman Di'Anno contributing only to the title track, \"Killers\" (the North American bonus track \"Twilight Zone\" was credited to Harris and Murray). Bruce Dickinson replaced Di'Anno after the release of \"Killers\", although he did not contribute any songwriting to \"The Number of the Beast\", released in 1982, which featured three songs co-written by guitarist Adrian Smith. \"The Number of the Beast\" also spawned Iron Maiden's first UK Singles Chart top ten in the form of \"Run to the Hills\", which charted at number seven on its release. It was not until 1983's \"Piece of Mind\" that the songwriting process became a more varied and collaborative approach, with just four of its nine tracks being credited solely to Harris, two to Dickinson and Smith, one to Harris and Murray, one to Dickinson alone, and one to Harris, Dickinson, and Smith. The Dickinson and Smith-penned \"Flight of Icarus\" was the first Iron Maiden single to chart in the United States, reaching number eight on the \"Billboard\" Mainstream Rock chart."

Vickers volunteered for this role but he was always happiest playing woodwind. His tough flute soloing on hard blues tracks such as \"Without You\" prefigured the work of Ian Anderson with Jethro Tull five years later. As the group were all multi-instrumentalists who delighted in instrumental solos, multi-tracking was used to allow Vickers to perform on guitar and woodwind on the same recordings, while drummer Mike Hugg similarly doubled on vibraphone.",

Later these loans would give the U.S. political influence and access to natural resources for U.S. companies. He refers to this as an \"economic hit man.\" Although he states that throughout his career he has always worked for private companies, and suggests a system of corporatocracy and greed, rather than a single conspiracy, he claims the involvement of the National Security Agency (NSA), with whom he had interviewed for a job before joining Main. According to the author, this interview effectively constituted an independent screening which led to his subsequent hiring as an economic hit man by Einar Greve, a vice president of the firm (and alleged NSA liaison)."
