However, more recent research extends early modern revenge tragedy to the 1560s with poet and classicist Jasper Heywood's translations of Seneca at Oxford University, including \"Troas\" (1559), \"Thyestes\" (1560), and \"Hercules Furens\" (1561). Additionally, Thomases Norton and Sackville's play \"Gorbuduc\" (1561) is considered an early revenge tragedy (almost twenty years prior to \"The Spanish Tragedy\"). Other well-known revenge tragedies include William Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\" (c.1599-1602) and \"Titus Andronicus\" (c.1588-1593) and Thomas Middleton's \"The Revenger's Tragedy\" (c.1606).",
