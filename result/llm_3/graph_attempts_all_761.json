NaGISA is the first project of the larger CoML effort (Census of Marine Life) to have global participation in actual field work. The actual procedures of this project involve inexpensive collection equipment (for easy universal participation). This equipment is used to photograph sampling sites, to actually take samples from the sites, and to process these samples. At each site throughout the world, samples are taken from the intertidal zone out to a depth of 10 meters (and optionally out to 20 meters depth). These samples are then processed (the organisms are isolated) and then analyzed and catalogued. The information (regarding the kind and number of organisms analyzed) is sent to the global headquarters of NaGISA- the University of Kyoto in Japan. All of this information is then collated on the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS website). The end goal of the larger CoML effort is to find what \"was\", what \"is\", and what \"will be\" in the world's oceans. For NaGISA the goal is to find this in the world's in-shore areas.",

The piece introduces some themes at the very outset of the piece which are manipulated and recapitulated over twenty minutes later. Charles Rosen believes that the work as whole fulfils his criterion for a sonata form. Moreover, within the one long sonata form, there exists a short sonata form, followed by a slow ternary, followed by a scherzo and fugue, followed by a finale. Thus, the single movement fulfills the standard of both a classical sonata form and a classical four movement piano sonata.",

She was expressive, light and dramatic in style. Prevost debuted at the Acad\u00e9mie d'Opera in the ballet, \"Atys\", later replacing Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se de Subligny as the female lead. In 1708, she performed with Jean Balon in the final scene of Corneille's \"Les Horaces\". The performance, though only of the final scene of the play and entirely in pantomime, is said to have caused the audience to weep. The \"pantomime\" came from the popular theaters of the time and freely used bold gestures and body language to communicate the narrative to the audience. The goal was to convey a story of meaning using purely movement, without spoken word. Maintaining her interest in the dramatic potential of dance, Prevost created a famous solo in 1714 called \"Les Caracteres de la Danse.\" Choreographed to a suite of dances by composer Jean Ferry Rebel, the \"characters\" depicted a series of lovers of varying ages and sexes, and Prevost enacted each one to a different piece of music: the bourree, the menuet, the passepied. She taught this solo to her two most accomplished female students: Marie Camargo and Marie Sall\u00e9. Camargo was the first to learn the solo for her debut at the Paris Opera. Her growing success incited jealousy in Prevost, and she relegated Camargo to the corps de ballet. One day however, Camargo made an spectacular impromptu improvisation solo for a missing male dancer. The arrival of Marie Salle, and her dramatic recreation of the famous solo into a pas de deux of rich emotional interaction, highlighted the different approaches to dance of the period: technical flash verses dramatic depth.",

She was expressive, light and dramatic in style. Prevost debuted at the Acad\u00e9mie d'Opera in the ballet, \"Atys\", later replacing Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se de Subligny as the female lead. In 1708, she performed with Jean Balon in the final scene of Corneille's \"Les Horaces\". The performance, though only of the final scene of the play and entirely in pantomime, is said to have caused the audience to weep. The \"pantomime\" came from the popular theaters of the time and freely used bold gestures and body language to communicate the narrative to the audience. The goal was to convey a story of meaning using purely movement, without spoken word. Maintaining her interest in the dramatic potential of dance, Prevost created a famous solo in 1714 called \"Les Caracteres de la Danse.\" Choreographed to a suite of dances by composer Jean Ferry Rebel, the \"characters\" depicted a series of lovers of varying ages and sexes, and Prevost enacted each one to a different piece of music: the bourree, the menuet, the passepied. She taught this solo to her two most accomplished female students: Marie Camargo and Marie Sall\u00e9. Camargo was the first to learn the solo for her debut at the Paris Opera. Her growing success incited jealousy in Prevost, and she relegated Camargo to the corps de ballet. One day however, Camargo made an spectacular impromptu improvisation solo for a missing male dancer. The arrival of Marie Salle, and her dramatic recreation of the famous solo into a pas de deux of rich emotional interaction, highlighted the different approaches to dance of the period: technical flash verses dramatic depth."

It describes encounters with Albert Einstein, Bob Dylan, and Stokely Carmichael, a dinner with W. H. Auden, and a phone call to James Baldwin. Hazel Carby called it one of two contemporary autobiographies that are \"absolutely central to any consideration of black manhood\" (the other being that of Miles Davis). Among many cultural events of the decade that he witnessed, Delany recounts his attendance at the first New York City performance of artist Allan Kaprow's \"18 Happenings in 6 Parts\", the 1959 performance piece that, for many, marks the end of modernism and the beginning of postmodernism. In section 17.4 of the University of Minnesota Press edition, he describes the event and its venue, and speculates on its artistic significance. The introduction puts an emphasis on the idea of the unreliable narrator; Delany's accounts often contrast his life as it \"felt\" to ways in which it actually occurred. In the chapter, The Future Is in the Present of the book \"Cruising Utopia\" by Jos\u00e9 Esteban Munoz, Delany's The Motion of Light in the Water serves to explain how the future, as a formed of utopia, can be \"glimpsed\" in the present through what Delany employed as \"the massed bodies\" of sexual dissidence.",

She was expressive, light and dramatic in style. Prevost debuted at the Acad\u00e9mie d'Opera in the ballet, \"Atys\", later replacing Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se de Subligny as the female lead. In 1708, she performed with Jean Balon in the final scene of Corneille's \"Les Horaces\". The performance, though only of the final scene of the play and entirely in pantomime, is said to have caused the audience to weep. The \"pantomime\" came from the popular theaters of the time and freely used bold gestures and body language to communicate the narrative to the audience. The goal was to convey a story of meaning using purely movement, without spoken word. Maintaining her interest in the dramatic potential of dance, Prevost created a famous solo in 1714 called \"Les Caracteres de la Danse.\" Choreographed to a suite of dances by composer Jean Ferry Rebel, the \"characters\" depicted a series of lovers of varying ages and sexes, and Prevost enacted each one to a different piece of music: the bourree, the menuet, the passepied. She taught this solo to her two most accomplished female students: Marie Camargo and Marie Sall\u00e9. Camargo was the first to learn the solo for her debut at the Paris Opera. Her growing success incited jealousy in Prevost, and she relegated Camargo to the corps de ballet. One day however, Camargo made an spectacular impromptu improvisation solo for a missing male dancer. The arrival of Marie Salle, and her dramatic recreation of the famous solo into a pas de deux of rich emotional interaction, highlighted the different approaches to dance of the period: technical flash verses dramatic depth.",

I immediately said I had when in point of fact I did not know what he meant, and there was a young man in the office with Sir David Cunnynghame called Lew Watt, and he said Lew Watt will do the technical side and we want you to subtitle an Italian picture in to English. I said certainly . I came out of his office and Lew Watt said to me you don't know what they're talking about do you, I said you're quite right, he said well I'll show you. And I started subtitling pictures with Lew Watt, I used to do the literary side, and he used to do the technical side, the spotting, and lengths, and we together did subtitles for 40 or 50 pictures. The funny thing was we subtitled pictures in Chinese, in Indian and for the Chinese picture I had to have a Chinese waiter with me to tell me where the subtitles [...] I had the Italian dialogue and I had the picture, they gave me a film and we did the spotting together with Lew Watt and the measurements and I used to type the script. We had the film, we had the print which used to run on the two sided thing. And Lew Watt was working all the day so we had to do this at night, so we either used to work at night till 2 o'clock in the morning or we used to work at the weekends.
