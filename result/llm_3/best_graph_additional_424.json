They became founding members of the Football League Second Division in 1892, where the club remained for two seasons, and are the only two seasons in the club's history where they have played professionally and in the Football League. In the 1894 season, they returned to amateur, regional football when they rejoined the Combination. Two season in the Cheshire League followed until the turn of the century, when Northwich joined the Manchester League in 1900, when they finished as runners-up. Two seasons later, for the first time, they won a league trophy as winners of the Manchester League in 1902. They departed the Manchester League in 1912 when they joined the second division of the Lancashire Combination, finishing 4th in the first season, which ensured their promotion to the first division. In 1919, they became founder members of the Cheshire County League, where they remained until the 1968 season, winning the league just once in the 1956\u201357 season. Following their departure from the Cheshire County League, they became founder members of the Northern Premier League. In 1979, they founded yet another league, the Alliance Premier League (now known as the Football Conference, where they remained until their relegation in the 2004\u201305 season. During their time in the Conference, they won the FA Trophy in the 1983\u201384 season, and finished runners-up twice in 1982 and 1995. They returned to the Conference National at their first attempt when they won the Conference North in the 2005\u201306 season. However, ongoing financial issues in the latter part of the 2000s saw them relegated twice in two season; in 2009 they were relegated back to the Conference North and then again the following season to the Northern Premier League Premier Division, where they are competing for the current season.",

These samples are then processed (the organisms are isolated) and then analyzed and catalogued. The information (regarding the kind and number of organisms analyzed) is sent to the global headquarters of NaGISA- the University of Kyoto in Japan.
