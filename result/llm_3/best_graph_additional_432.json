            "Life Begins at 40 (song)\n\"Life Begins at 40\" is a song by John Lennon. It was written in 1980, the year that both Lennon and Ringo Starr turned 40 years of age. Lennon recorded a demo of the song at his home, but it was not recorded at any of the sessions for his comeback album, \"Double Fantasy.\" Instead, he intended to give the song to Starr to record on his own forthcoming album, \"Can't Fight Lightning.\" The song's amiable country feel was well suited to Starr's singing style. After Lennon's murder in December 1980, those plans were shelved. However, Lennon's demo was eventually issued in 1998 on the \"John Lennon Anthology\" box set.",

            "Rock 'n' Roll (John Lennon album)\nRock 'n' Roll is the sixth studio album by John Lennon. Released in 1975, it is an album of late 1950s and early 1960s songs as covered by Lennon. Recording the album was problematic and spanned an entire year: Phil Spector produced sessions in October 1973 at A&M Studios, and Lennon produced sessions in October 1974 at Record Plant Studios (East). Lennon was being sued by Morris Levy over copyright infringement of one line in his song \"Come Together\". As part of an agreement, Lennon had to include three Levy-owned songs on \"Rock 'n' Roll\". Spector disappeared with the session recordings and was subsequently involved in a motor accident, leaving the album's tracks unrecoverable until the beginning of the \"Walls and Bridges\" sessions. With \"Walls and Bridges\" coming out first, featuring one Levy-owned song, Levy sued Lennon expecting to see Lennon's \"Rock 'n' Roll\" album.",
