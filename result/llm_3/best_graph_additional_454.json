            "James Joyce\nJames Augustine Aloysius Joyce (2 February 1882 \u2013 13 January 1941) was an Irish novelist, short story writer, and poet. He contributed to the modernist avant-garde and is regarded as one of the most influential and important authors of the 20th century. Joyce is best known for \"Ulysses\" (1922), a landmark work in which the episodes of Homer's \"Odyssey\" are paralleled in a variety of literary styles, perhaps most prominently stream of consciousness. Other well-known works are the short-story collection \"Dubliners\" (1914), and the novels \"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\" (1916) and \"Finnegans Wake\" (1939). His other writings include three books of poetry, a play, his published letters and occasional journalism.",
