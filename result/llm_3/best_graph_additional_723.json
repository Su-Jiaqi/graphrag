Both fuels are stored in the same common tank, and the engine is capable of burning any proportion of the resulting blend in the combustion chamber. This is achieved through automatic adjustments to fuel injection and spark timing based on the actual blend detected by a fuel composition sensor. Flex-fuel vehicles are common in the United States, with a large fleet of cars and light trucks in operation.\n\nOn the other hand, bi-fuel vehicles have multifuel engines capable of running on two separate fuels, such as gasoline or diesel and an alternate fuel like natural gas, LPG, or hydrogen.

The two fuels are stored in separate tanks, and the engine runs on one fuel at a time, or in some cases, both fuels are used in unison.\n\nIn summary, the main difference between flex-fuel and bi-fuel vehicles lies in the storage and usage of the alternative fuel. Flex-fuel vehicles store both fuels in the same tank and can use any proportion of the blend, while bi-fuel vehicles store the fuels in separate tanks and run on one fuel at a time.

The two fuels are stored in separate tanks and the engine runs on one fuel at a time in some cases, in others both fuels are used in unison.

            "Hydrogen vehicle\nA hydrogen vehicle is a vehicle that uses hydrogen as its onboard fuel for motive power. Hydrogen vehicles include hydrogen fueled space rockets, as well as automobiles and other transportation vehicles. The power plants of such vehicles convert the chemical energy of hydrogen to mechanical energy either by burning hydrogen in an internal combustion engine, or by reacting hydrogen with oxygen in a fuel cell to run electric motors. Widespread use of hydrogen for fueling transportation is a key element of a proposed hydrogen economy.",
            "Flexible-fuel vehicle\nA flexible-fuel vehicle (FFV) or dual-fuel vehicle (colloquially called a flex-fuel vehicle) is an alternative fuel vehicle with an internal combustion engine designed to run on more than one fuel, usually gasoline blended with either ethanol or methanol fuel, and both fuels are stored in the same common tank. Modern flex-fuel engines are capable of burning any proportion of the resulting blend in the combustion chamber as fuel injection and spark timing are adjusted automatically according to the actual blend detected by a fuel composition sensor. Flex-fuel vehicles are distinguished from bi-fuel vehicles, where two fuels are stored in separate tanks and the engine runs on one fuel at a time, for example, compressed natural gas (CNG), liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), or hydrogen.",

Bi-fuel vehicles have the capability to switch back and forth from gasoline or diesel to the other fuel, manually or automatically.",
            "Hydrogen highway (Japan)\nJapan's hydrogen highway is a network of hydrogen filling stations placed along roadsides that provide fuel for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (HFCV). An HFCV is a vehicle that uses a fuel cell to convert hydrogen energy into electrical energy. The hydrogen that is used in fuel cell vehicles can be made using fossil or renewable resources. The hydrogen highway is necessary for HFCVs to be used. HFCV reduce tailpipe emissions of greenhouse gases. By May 2016, there were approximately 80 hydrogen fueling stations in Japan.",

The fuel cells made at this time were most similar to today's phosphoric acid fuel cells. Most hydrogen fuel cells today are of the proton exchange membrane (PEM) type. A PEM converts the chemical energy released during the electrochemical reaction of hydrogen and oxygen into electrical energy. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 was the first national legislation that called for large-scale hydrogen research. A five-year program was conducted that investigated the production of hydrogen from renewable energy sources and the feasibility of existing natural gas pipelines to carry hydrogen.
