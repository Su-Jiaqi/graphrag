The Powerhouse was the last of the original buildings at Cal Poly to be constructed; however, it is now the only remaining original building on its campus. The building originally served as a power plant run by students and two full-time supervisors; it also held Mechanics and Electrical Engineering classes. The Powerhouse stopped generating power in the 1940s and was replaced entirely and abandoned in 1955. In 1967, the building found a new use when the school's College of Architecture and Environmental Design decided to hold classes there. The college continued to hold classes in the building even after the construction of a new architecture building, and only stopped in 1990 when the school's administration ordered the building to be abandoned."
