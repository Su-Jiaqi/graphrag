The ride opened in 2013, replacing The Rattler, a wooden roller coaster, by putting a new steel track on top of The Rattler's wooden support structure. The distance between the lowest and highest points of the first drop was increased from 124 to and the drop was made steeper by changing the angle to 81 degrees. The resulting modifications increased the speed of the trains from 65 to .

When the bodyboarder detaches completely from the wave surface or the lip the trick is called an \"air roll\" or \"aerial roll\". Other variations include the \"barrel roll\" where the roll is completed inside the barrel, and the \"rollo takeoff\" which is performed while catching the wave. This trick was named by someone in the industry. I remember the story where Pat Caldwell did the roll and Jack Lindholm or whoever saw him do it and commented \"what do you call that an el rollo\".

            "Negative inversion\nIn linguistics, negative inversion is one of many types of subject-auxiliary inversion in English. A negation (e.g. \"not\", \"no\", \"never\", \"nothing\", etc.) or a word that implies negation (\"only\", \"hardly\", \"scarcely\") or a phrase containing one of these words precedes the finite auxiliary verb necessitating that the subject and finite verb undergo inversion. Negative inversion is a phenomenon of English syntax. The V2 word order of other Germanic languages does not allow one to acknowledge negative inversion as a specific phenomenon, since their V2 principle, which is mostly absent from English, allows inversion to occur much more often than in English. While negative inversion is a common occurrence in English, a solid understanding of just what elicits the inversion has not yet been established. It is, namely, not entirely clear why certain fronted expressions containing a negation elicit negative inversion, but others do not.",

Although Burroughs & Chapin attempted to sell the ride along with the Haunted Hotel, Log Flume, Treasure Hunt, and a few other rides, the ride was deemed too expensive a task to dismantle and relocate, and was ultimately demolished in March 2007. The only part of the ride not demolished were the two Gerstlauer trains used on the ride. These trains were shipped to Kings Island, an amusement park in Mason, Ohio. They were then repainted and installed on Son of Beast, which was at the time the world's tallest and fastest wooden roller coaster.

The music played is modern and easily danceable, historically disco but in modern times including almost any form of dance, pop or rock music. The concept originated as a fad in the 1970s when the disco craze was at its height, peaking around 1980 and inspiring several roller-disco magazines. In 1984 the fad arrived in the United Kingdom and many roller discos popped up all over the country s of 2006 , the craze has largely discontinued, although many 1970s era roller-discos are still open and successful. Also, it experienced a mild revival in the early 2000s, especially in the mid-eastern United States , where certain clubs continue to host roller disco nights. Some now use in-line roller-blades. Roller discos are also popular among older children and young teenagers, especially for parties. As in other discos, special effects such as fog machines and flashing traffic lights are often used. To minimise the risk of injury, the organisers of roller discos often only allow participants to skate in one direction at a time, so that they do not crash into one another, although many roller discos have a \"free skate\" section in the middle of the roller rink.",
            "Temple of the Night Hawk\nTemple of the Night Hawk is an enclosed roller coaster located at Phantasialand. Founded in 1988 after 18 months of construction, the ride was originally called \u2018'Space Center'\u2019. The ride led passengers past models of rockets and emulated asteroids and the darkened hall was dimly lit with thousands of tiny spots of light to resemble stars. Due to the construction of the neighbouring Wurze Town in 2001, the roller coaster was redeveloped with a fantasy jungle theme and was renamed as the \"Temple of the Night Hawk\". The roller coaster is now completely dark. Until 2006 there were some green moving lights and strobe lights in the first lifthill, still present today, but not operational. In 2008 the Lights on the coaster trains were turned off or broke down and have never been repaired since then. Till 2010 there was a green laser projection with the outlines of a flying hawk and until June 2012, there were some red strobe-lights at the final brakerun. In 2011, the park installed new strobe lights in the first lifthill, which broke down after about two months, and were never repaired since then. The ride has four trains and one spare train for repairs each with seven cars. Each car has two rows of seats each holding two people. During the four-minute ride time the trains are lifted by three lift hill chains, 1.174 metres of track. The roller coaster is therefore one of the longest indoor roller coasters in the World, slightly beaten by \"Mindbender\" in Galaxyland Amusement Park, Canada. The hall in which the track is located is around 120,000m\u00b3 in size and rests on 180 concrete pillars which are 12 metres deep in the ground.
