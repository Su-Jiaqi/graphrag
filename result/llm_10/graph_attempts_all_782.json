Cleveland played all of their home games at Cleveland Browns Stadium in Cleveland, Ohio. In the 2008 season, the Browns failed to score a touchdown for 24 consecutive quarters.

The Browns failed to improve upon their 3\u201313 record from their previous season, finishing 1\u201315, their worst record in franchise history. They started the season 0\u201314, their worst 14-game start in franchise history, and in so doing, clinched a losing record for a franchise record ninth straight season, failed to make the playoffs for a franchise record 14th straight season, finished in fourth place in the AFC North for the sixth straight season, went 0\u20136 within the division, failed to win a road game in a season for only the second time in franchise history (first occurred during the 1975 season), and set a franchise record for most consecutive losses, losing 17 straight games going back to their final three games of the previous season. They also extended their road losing streak to 13 games, a streak that began in Week 7 of the 2015 season, when they lost their final five road games. The Browns were also the first team to start 0\u201314 since the Detroit Lions went winless during 2008, the first team to finish with a 1\u201315 record since 2009, and only the 10th team in NFL history to finish with 15 losses.

The Lions entered their third season under head coach Rod Marinelli and were looking to improve on the 7\u20139 record they put together in 2007. Instead, the Lions had one of the worst seasons in pro sports history. The team lost all sixteen of their games in 2008, becoming the first team since the 1976 Tampa Bay Buccaneers to end an NFL season with no wins and no tied games as well as the first and only team to do it since the schedule was expanded to sixteen games. The Lions were mathematically eliminated from the playoffs by Week 11, when they stood 0\u201310. The team's victory over the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 16 of 2007 stood as their last until Week 3 of the 2009 season. From the time the Lions recorded a win over the Denver Broncos in 2007 to reach 6\u20132, the team went 5\u201347 over their following 52 games (including all of 2008 and 2009) before winning four games in a row at the end of the 2010 season. As of 2017, this is the only team in NFL history to finish a season with a 0\u201316 record. The 2016 Cleveland Browns and the 2009 St. Louis Rams came close to 0\u201316, both going 1\u201315.",

The Lions and the 1982 Cleveland Browns are the only two teams with a losing record to qualify as wildcards. In 2010, the Seattle Seahawks became the third team with a losing record to qualify for the playoffs and the first team to win a division title with a losing record (however, the Seahawks accomplished the former in a full-length season).

Subsequent legal actions by the city of Cleveland and Browns season ticket holders led the NFL to broker a compromise that saw the Browns history, records, and intellectual property remain in Cleveland. In return, Modell was permitted to move his football organization to Baltimore where he established the Baltimore Ravens. The Ravens are officially regarded by the NFL as an expansion team that began play in . The city of Cleveland agreed to demolish Cleveland Stadium and build a new stadium on the same site, and the NFL agreed to reactivate the Browns by the 1999 season through either an expansion draft or a relocated franchise.

He and his family were interned in Douglas on the Isle of Man during the Second World War. He began his career working for Filippo Del Giudice and Two Cities Films. When Two Cities was absorbed into the Rank Organisation in the mid-1940s Coen was employed by Sir David Cunynghame of London Film Productions as a subtitler. As Coen later described it in an interview, he did not know anything about subtitling at the time, and learned on the job: I finally got a phone call from London Films, Sir Cunnyngham, that 's it, who asked me whether I had ever subtitles pictures. I immediately said I had when in point of fact I did not know what he meant, and there was a young man in the office with Sir David Cunnynghame called Lew Watt, and he said Lew Watt will do the technical side and we want you to subtitle an Italian picture in to English. I said certainly . I came out of his office and Lew Watt said to me you don't know what they're talking about do you, I said you're quite right, he said well I'll show you. And I started subtitling pictures with Lew Watt, I used to do the literary side, and he used to do the technical side, the spotting, and lengths, and we together did subtitles for 40 or 50 pictures. The funny thing was we subtitled pictures in Chinese, in Indian and for the Chinese picture I had to have a Chinese waiter with me to tell me where the subtitles [...] I had the Italian dialogue and I had the picture, they gave me a film and we did the spotting together with Lew Watt and the measurements and I used to type the script. We had the film, we had the print which used to run on the two sided thing. And Lew Watt was working all the day so we had to do this at night, so we either used to work at night till 2 o'clock in the morning or we used to work at the weekends. There was always the problem that the Movieola might break down and so we had spare keys of other cutting rooms in in elm St in case we were caught. And that was how we started.Coen later founded his own company Kenilworth Film Productions and spent most of the post-war years producing second features. He made a dozen films in partnership with the director Charles Saunders. He later produced the 1971 horror film \"Burke & Hare\" and the comedies \"Au Pair Girls\" and \"Intimate Games.\"",
