Next, for each film identified in the first step, we need to retrieve the main cast list, again using a retrieval method. Finally, we examine the cast lists to determine which actors are Canadian, combining retrieval of actor nationality information with reasoning to check for Canadian nationality. The sequence concludes with identifying Canadian actors who starred in the films identified in the first step."
