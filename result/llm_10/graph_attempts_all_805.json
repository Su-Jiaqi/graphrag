He was the elder brother of the great Middlesex bowler J.T.Hearne and was a bowler of somewhat similar style, being a medium paced right-hander with great accuracy and a pronounced off-break. However, unlike his younger sibling, Walter Hearne was not physically robust and suffered throughout his short career from knee problems, which ultimately led to his giving up the game at for the time a very young age. Also, even in his best season, Walter Hearne did not demonstrate that he possessed John Thomas\u2019 sting on a firm pitch: indeed on the best wicket he had to bowl during 1894 at the Oval, he was severely punished taking only two wickets for 129. There was, however, no denying his deadliness on sticky wickets: in one spell during 1894 he took in three games thirty-eight wickets for 241 runs, including thirteen for 98 against Surrey at Catford. Walter Hearne's cricket basically began and ended with his bowling: prior to making a score of 34 not out in his last-ever match his highest score had been only 22, and he was not a strong field as his more famous brother was.",

Under less preservative conditions however, only a dark circular stain of organic material may be left in the fill of the posthole observable in plan and section. This differs in consistency from the less organic backfill of the posthole and can be identified simply through this change in make-up. The size and depth and of the postpipe can provide information as to any reuse of the posthole especially if several different postpipes can be identified. They can also indicate the species of wood used and help suggest the nature of the structure that the timber once supported.

Under less preservative conditions however, only a dark circular stain of organic material may be left in the fill of the posthole observable in plan and section. This differs in consistency from the less organic backfill of the posthole and can be identified simply through this change in make-up. The size and depth and of the postpipe can provide information as to any reuse of the posthole especially if several different postpipes can be identified. They can also indicate the species of wood used and help suggest the nature of the structure that the timber once supported.

However, unlike his younger sibling, Walter Hearne was not physically robust and suffered throughout his short career from knee problems, which ultimately led to his giving up the game at for the time a very young age. Also, even in his best season, Walter Hearne did not demonstrate that he possessed John Thomas\u2019 sting on a firm pitch: indeed on the best wicket he had to bowl during 1894 at the Oval, he was severely punished taking only two wickets for 129. There was, however, no denying his deadliness on sticky wickets: in one spell during 1894 he took in three games thirty-eight wickets for 241 runs, including thirteen for 98 against Surrey at Catford. Walter Hearne's cricket basically began and ended with his bowling: prior to making a score of 34 not out in his last-ever match his highest score had been only 22, and he was not a strong field as his more famous brother was.",

            "Lifestyle trends and media\nLifestyle changes have been increasing slowly since the introduction of media. Media \u2013 films, television shows, magazines, and more recently, the Internet (i.e. self-written blogs and popular websites) are the main sources of lifestyle influence around the world. Lifestyle changes include how people eat, dress, and communicate. Celebrity endorsements are prevalent. Lifestyle trends have always been influenced by the wealthy and famous, whether they are spotted at leisure or in a paid advertisement. At the dawn of the media age, the newspaper, popular magazines like \"Life\", and TV allowed the general public glimpse lifestyles that before were only available to the imagination. After its creation, the Internet became arguably the most powerful medium for spotting and influencing trends, not just by celebrities but by the average person. The computer era has changed the way people obtain their news, perspectives and communication. Magazines are still popular, but advertisers now often supply a web address where consumers can visit for more information than a print ad can provide. The average American household has two personal computers, making the Internet easily accessible. The rise of user-generated content is exemplified by the fact that anyone with Internet access can create a blog or an online journal, whether personal or commercial, which might detail someone's experience in a new restaurant, a purchased item of clothing or knickknack, or a review to a film. With the advent of the Android phone and its relative ease of uploading photos to social media sites such as Facebook, one can get an idea of how quickly an idea, pub review, or coveted object can be shared. Advertisers have always been privy to the strength of word-of-mouth and have tapped into social media, including Facebook, Twitter, and Tumblr to make their wares known. Douglas Kellner writes, \"Radio, television, film, and the other products of media culture provide materials out of which we forge our very identities; our sense of selfhood; our notion of what it means to be male or female; our sense of class, of ethnicity and race, of nationality, of sexuality; and of \"us\" and \"them.\"\"",

            "Toyota Tercel\nThe Toyota Tercel is a subcompact manufactured by Toyota from 1978 to 1999 across five generations, in five body configurations sized between the Corolla and the Starlet. Manufactured at the Takaoka plant in Toyota City, Japan, and sharing its platform with the Cynos (a.k.a. Paseo) and the Starlet, the Tercel was marketed variously as the Toyota Corolla II\u2014sold at Toyota Japanese dealerships called \"Toyota Corolla Store\"s\u2014and was replaced by the Toyota Platz in 1999. It was also known as the Toyota Corsa and sold at Toyopet Store locations. Starting with the second generation, the Tercel dealership network was changed to Toyota Vista Stores, as its badge engineered sibling, the Corolla II, was exclusive to Toyota Corolla Store locations.",
            "Swedish governmental line of succession\nThe Swedish constitution of 1974 allows the Prime Minister of Sweden to appoint one of the Ministers in the cabinet as Deputy Prime Minister (\"bitr\u00e4dande statsminister\", also unofficially known as \"vice statsminister\", \"Vice Prime Minister\"), in case the Prime Minister for some reason is prevented from performing his or her duties. However, if a Deputy Prime Minister has not been appointed, the Minister in the cabinet who has served the longest time (and if there are several with equal experience the one who is oldest) takes over as head of government. Note that the person acting as Prime Minister does not do so on a permanent basis: if a Prime Minister dies, resigns or loses a vote of confidence in the Riksdag, the Speaker of the Riksdag will then confer with the parties of the Riksdag and propose a new Prime Minister, who must be tolerated by a majority of the Riksdag. If the Prime Minister has resigned or lost a vote of confidence, he or she will remain the head of a government \"ad interim\" until the new Prime Minister assumes his or her office. The only case where the governmental line of succession becomes relevant is when the Prime Minister dies (upon which the person next in the line of succession serves as the head of a government \"ad interim\") or when the Prime Minister is on leave or for any other reason incapable of serving, but still remains in office. This might be compared to the Presidential line of succession in the United States, where the person next in line assumes the Presidency throughout the remainder of the term if the President dies, resigns or is impeached.",

            "Suzuki F10D engine\nSuzuki F10D engine is an inline 4-cylinder 1061cc engine that was developed in India by Maruti Suzuki for the domestic market. It was debuted in the Maruti Wagon-R in India in 2001. It was briefly installed in Maruti Alto and it was the engine that the first Maruti Zen Estilo came with. This engine is very similar to the 3-cylinder F8D 12-valve engine that was optional on the Maruti 800 at the time. The bore and stroke of F10D is the same as that of the smaller sibling and shares quite a few parts like pistons, rings, conrods and valves. The cast-iron engine block is very similar to that of the older F10A 970cc engine that powered the earlier Maruti Gypsy and Maruti 1000. Both F10A and F10D shares the same stroke length; but interchangeability of parts between these two engines is not known.",
            "Walter Hearne\nWalter Hearne (15 January 1864 \u2013 2 April 1925) was an English cricketer for Kent CCC. He was the elder brother of the great Middlesex bowler J.T.Hearne and was a bowler of somewhat similar style, being a medium paced right-hander with great accuracy and a pronounced off-break. However, unlike his younger sibling, Walter Hearne was not physically robust and suffered throughout his short career from knee problems, which ultimately led to his giving up the game at for the time a very young age. Also, even in his best season, Walter Hearne did not demonstrate that he possessed John Thomas\u2019 sting on a firm pitch: indeed on the best wicket he had to bowl during 1894 at the Oval, he was severely punished taking only two wickets for 129. There was, however, no denying his deadliness on sticky wickets: in one spell during 1894 he took in three games thirty-eight wickets for 241 runs, including thirteen for 98 against Surrey at Catford. Walter Hearne's cricket basically began and ended with his bowling: prior to making a score of 34 not out in his last-ever match his highest score had been only 22, and he was not a strong field as his more famous brother was.",
            "Anything's Wild\nAnything's Wild is a video poker game that allows the player to select any card (by rank) to act as the \"wild card\". The game is a variation of Deuces Wild and is based on five card draw where the player is dealt a five card hand. The player can then choose which cards to keep or discard and is dealt new cards accordingly. The payoff is based on the value of the hand.
