                "Hazeldean Mall\nHazeldean Mall is a shopping centre located in the Kanata district of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It is located at the intersection of Eagleson Road and Hazeldean Road, where Hazeldean Road turns into Robertson Road. It was the first enclosed shopping centre constructed in Kanata. The development of the mall was approved shortly before the incorporation of the (then) City of Kanata, and its approval lead to a legal battle between the constituent parts of the new municipality over the appropriate location of what would at that time be the new city's main commercial hub.",
                "Richards-Sewall House\nThe Richards-Sewall House is a historic house in Urbana, Ohio, United States. Located along College Street on the city's western side, it was built in 1853 in a combination of the Queen Anne, Stick/Eastlake, and Gothic Revival architectural styles. Although it was built as and is currently used as a single residence, the house has also been used as a dormitory. Its most significant resident was Frank Sewall, president of what is now Urbana University during the 1870s. A native of Maine, Sewall was a minister of the New Church who moved to Urbana upon being elected to the presidency in 1870. In addition to his position as college president, Sewall taught a range of courses at the college and served as the pastor of the New Church congregation in Urbana. While living in Urbana, Sewall served as president of the church's Ohio governing body, published multiple books, and chaired the church's board of missions.",
                "United Church of Christ in Keene\nThe United Church of Christ in Keene (also known as The First Church or Church at the Head of the Square) is a historic Congregational church at 23 Central Square in Keene, New Hampshire, United States. The oldest portion of this church is its timber frame, a 50 by structure that was built in 1786 as the town's fourth meeting house. In 1828 the meeting house was rotated and moved, nearly to its present location, and the Greek Revival temple front with Doric columns was added, as was the tower and steeple. These alterations were supposedly inspired by the recent (1817\u201318) construction of the Third Fitzwilliam Meetinghouse. In 1859-60 the church was again moved, this time a short distance to make room for an enlarged sanctuary, as designed by the Worcester firm of Boyden & Ball. The building exterior has been little altered since; the steeple was recreated from photographs after the original was toppled by the New England Hurricane of 1938. In 1924 a two-story brick parish house was built next to the church.",
                "Hoxne manor\nHoxne manor in Suffolk, England was mentioned in the 1086 Domesday Survey as a seat of the East Anglian bishops, from around that date being the bishops of Norwich, a transition from the bishops of Thetford. The Domesday name of Hoxne hundred, annexed to the manor, was \"Bishop's Hundred\". At this point Herbert Losinga took Hoxne as a key location from which to compete with the Abbot of St Edmunds; he rededicated the church at Hoxne to honour Edmund the Martyr, and kept control of the Hoxne manor house, though himself locating elsewhere."
