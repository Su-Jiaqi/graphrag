The 1981 follow-up, \"Killers\", was written almost entirely by the bassist, with frontman Di'Anno contributing only to the title track, \"Killers\" (the North American bonus track \"Twilight Zone\" was credited to Harris and Murray). Bruce Dickinson replaced Di'Anno after the release of \"Killers\", although he did not contribute any songwriting to \"The Number of the Beast\", released in 1982, which featured three songs co-written by guitarist Adrian Smith. \"The Number of the Beast\" also spawned Iron Maiden's first UK Singles Chart top ten in the form of \"Run to the Hills\", which charted at number seven on its release. It was not until 1983's \"Piece of Mind\" that the songwriting process became a more varied and collaborative approach, with just four of its nine tracks being credited solely to Harris, two to Dickinson and Smith, one to Harris and Murray, one to Dickinson alone, and one to Harris, Dickinson, and Smith. The Dickinson and Smith-penned \"Flight of Icarus\" was the first Iron Maiden single to chart in the United States, reaching number eight on the \"Billboard\" Mainstream Rock chart."
