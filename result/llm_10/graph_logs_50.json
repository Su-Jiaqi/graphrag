It was named for John L. Merriam, a Minnesota banker and politician. Completed by the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad in 1880, it shortened the route Milwaukee Road trains took between downtown Saint Paul and downtown Minneapolis. Previous trains would exit Saint Paul and follow the Mississippi River southwest until crossing at Fort Snelling where they would follow the path of today's Hiawatha Avenue (Minnesota State Highway 55) and METRO Blue Line toward the Milwaukee Road Depot. Originally built as an interurban route, it was eventually converted for heavy rail traffic because the Twin City Rapid Transit streetcar system had taken over the local transit market.",

Subsequently, it establishes the branch's starting point, which is crucial for distance calculations. Then, it retrieves the distances from the starting point to the station and from Liverpool to the starting point separately. Finally, it combines these distances to compute the total distance from Liverpool to Aughton Park station, thereby answering the original question."
