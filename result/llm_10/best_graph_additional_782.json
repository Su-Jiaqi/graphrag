The Browns finished with a 4\u201312 record and failed to qualify for the playoffs. The season marked Romeo Crennel's fourth (and what would be final) year as head coach of the Browns. Cleveland played all of their home games at Cleveland Browns Stadium in Cleveland, Ohio. In the 2008 season, the Browns failed to score a touchdown for 24 consecutive quarters. Also from 2008 to present, the Browns have failed to obtain a winning record, thus they failed to make the playoffs for the seventh straight season.",
            "2016 Cleveland Browns season\nThe 2016 Cleveland Browns season was the franchise's 68th season as a professional sports franchise, its 64th as a member of the National Football League and its first under head coach Hue Jackson and de facto general manager Sashi Brown. The Browns failed to improve upon their 3\u201313 record from their previous season, finishing 1\u201315, their worst record in franchise history. They started the season 0\u201314, their worst 14-game start in franchise history, and in so doing, clinched a losing record for a franchise record ninth straight season, failed to make the playoffs for a franchise record 14th straight season, finished in fourth place in the AFC North for the sixth straight season, went 0\u20136 within the division, failed to win a road game in a season for only the second time in franchise history (first occurred during the 1975 season), and set a franchise record for most consecutive losses, losing 17 straight games going back to their final three games of the previous season. They also extended their road losing streak to 13 games, a streak that began in Week 7 of the 2015 season, when they lost their final five road games. The Browns were also the first team to start 0\u201314 since the Detroit Lions went winless during 2008, the first team to finish with a 1\u201315 record since 2009, and only the 10th team in NFL history to finish with 15 losses. The Browns' lone victory was a 20\u201317 win over the San Diego Chargers in Week 16.",
            "1982 Detroit Lions season\nThe 1982 Detroit Lions season was the 53rd season in franchise history. An NFL players strike shortened the regular season to nine games. The Lions qualified for their first postseason appearance since 1970. The NFL changed the playoff format due to the strike. The Lions became one of only four teams to ever qualify for the playoffs despite having a losing record. The Lions and the 1982 Cleveland Browns are the only two teams with a losing record to qualify as wildcards. In 2010, the Seattle Seahawks became the third team with a losing record to qualify for the playoffs and the first team to win a division title with a losing record (however, the Seahawks accomplished the former in a full-length season). The Lions lost to the Washington Redskins at RFK Stadium in the first round of the playoffs.",
            "1952 Detroit Lions season\nThe Detroit Lions season resulted in the Lions winning their second National Football League (NFL) championship, having won their first championship 17 years earlier in 1935. The team's co-captains were halfback Bob Hoernschemeyer and defensive tackle John Prchlik, and defensive end Jim Doran was selected as the team's most valuable player. In their third year under head coach Buddy Parker, the 1952 Lions compiled a 9\u20133 record during the regular season, finished in a tie with the Los Angeles Rams for first place in the NFL's National Conference, defeated the Rams in a tiebreaker game, and defeated the Cleveland Browns, 17\u20137, in the 1953 NFL Championship Game at Municipal Stadium in Cleveland.",
            "2008 Detroit Lions season\nThe 2008 Detroit Lions season was the 79th season for the franchise in the National Football League. The Lions entered their third season under head coach Rod Marinelli and were looking to improve on the 7\u20139 record they put together in 2007. Instead, the Lions had one of the worst seasons in pro sports history. The team lost all sixteen of their games in 2008, becoming the first team since the 1976 Tampa Bay Buccaneers to end an NFL season with no wins and no tied games as well as the first and only team to do it since the schedule was expanded to sixteen games. The Lions were mathematically eliminated from the playoffs by Week 11, when they stood 0\u201310. The team's victory over the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 16 of 2007 stood as their last until Week 3 of the 2009 season. From the time the Lions recorded a win over the Denver Broncos in 2007 to reach 6\u20132, the team went 5\u201347 over their following 52 games (including all of 2008 and 2009) before winning four games in a row at the end of the 2010 season. As of 2017, this is the only team in NFL history to finish a season with a 0\u201316 record. The 2016 Cleveland Browns and the 2009 St. Louis Rams came close to 0\u201316, both going 1\u201315.",

The 1960 Browns compiled an 8\u20133\u20131 record, and finished second in the NFL's Eastern Conference, behind the NFL champion Philadelphia Eagles. As runner-up, the Browns qualified for the inaugural third place Playoff Bowl in Miami, but lost 17\u201316 to the Detroit Lions on January 7.",
            "Cleveland Browns relocation controversy\nThe Cleveland Browns relocation controversy, sometimes referred to by fans as \"The Move\", was the decision by then-Browns owner Art Modell to relocate the National Football League (NFL)'s Cleveland Browns from its long-time home of Cleveland to Baltimore during the 1995 NFL season. Subsequent legal actions by the city of Cleveland and Browns season ticket holders led the NFL to broker a compromise that saw the Browns history, records, and intellectual property remain in Cleveland. In return, Modell was permitted to move his football organization to Baltimore where he established the Baltimore Ravens. The Ravens are officially regarded by the NFL as an expansion team that began play in . The city of Cleveland agreed to demolish Cleveland Stadium and build a new stadium on the same site, and the NFL agreed to reactivate the Browns by the 1999 season through either an expansion draft or a relocated franchise. The Browns were officially reactivated in 1998 through the expansion process and resumed play in 1999.",

During the offseason, the team acquired Joe Johnson from the Phoenix Suns, and signed free agent Zaza Pachulia. However, tragedy struck as center Jason Collier suffered a heart attack during the preseason and died suddenly on October 15.

He learned the craft of football coaching at the University of Minnesota under Bernie Bierman, his former coach at Tulane. At Pitt he coached future Pro Football Hall of Famer Joe Schmidt and won Pittsburgh's \"Dapper Dan\" sports award in 1952. Dawson's greatest successes as a coach, however, were with Tulane and Buffalo. His 1939 Tulane squad went through the season undefeated before a disappointing loss to Texas A&M in the Sugar Bowl. In 1948 his Buffalo Bills team captured the AAFC Eastern Division title in a playoff against the Baltimore Colts, though they ultimately lost the AAFC Championship Game to the Cleveland Browns. Dawson's final won-loss record was 36\u201319\u20134 at Tulane, 9\u201311\u20131 at Pitt, and 19\u201325\u20134 at Buffalo.",

He was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in the fifth round of the 2011 NFL Draft. With the Patriots, he won Super Bowl LI over the Atlanta Falcons. He played college football at the University of Pittsburgh. Lewis has also played for the Cleveland Browns and Indianapolis Colts. His Patriots teammate, receiver Julian Edelman, has nicknamed Lewis both \"Jitterbug\" and \"Little Dirty\". Lewis had not played for two seasons before signing with the Patriots in 2015, and was a significant contributor to the New England offense before a season-ending knee injury in Week 9 put him out of the line-up. Two reconstructive surgeries on his damaged knee kept him sidelined until part way through the 2016 season, his return on November 12, 2016 made a direct impact; his career-defining performance coming in the Patriots over the Houston Texans, where Lewis had 188 all-purpose yards and became the first player in NFL history to score a touchdown on a rush, a reception, and a kick return during the same playoff game. Notably, as of the end of the 2016-2017 season, Lewis has never played in a game which the Patriots have subsequently lost."

When Two Cities was absorbed into the Rank Organisation in the mid-1940s Coen was employed by Sir David Cunynghame of London Film Productions as a subtitler. As Coen later described it in an interview, he did not know anything about subtitling at the time, and learned on the job: I finally got a phone call from London Films, Sir Cunnyngham, that 's it, who asked me whether I had ever subtitles pictures. I immediately said I had when in point of fact I did not know what he meant, and there was a young man in the office with Sir David Cunnynghame called Lew Watt, and he said Lew Watt will do the technical side and we want you to subtitle an Italian picture in to English. I said certainly . I came out of his office and Lew Watt said to me you don't know what they're talking about do you, I said you're quite right, he said well I'll show you. And I started subtitling pictures with Lew Watt, I used to do the literary side, and he used to do the technical side, the spotting, and lengths, and we together did subtitles for 40 or 50 pictures. The funny thing was we subtitled pictures in Chinese, in Indian and for the Chinese picture I had to have a Chinese waiter with me to tell me where the subtitles [...] I had the Italian dialogue and I had the picture, they gave me a film and we did the spotting together with Lew Watt and the measurements and I used to type the script. We had the film, we had the print which used to run on the two sided thing. And Lew Watt was working all the day so we had to do this at night, so we either used to work at night till 2 o'clock in the morning or we used to work at the weekends. There was always the problem that the Movieola might break down and so we had spare keys of other cutting rooms in in elm St in case we were caught.

So named for the Japanese word \"nagisa\" (\"where the land meets the sea\"), it is an Apronym. NaGISA is the first project of the larger CoML effort (Census of Marine Life) to have global participation in actual field work. The actual procedures of this project involve inexpensive collection equipment (for easy universal participation). This equipment is used to photograph sampling sites, to actually take samples from the sites, and to process these samples. At each site throughout the world, samples are taken from the intertidal zone out to a depth of 10 meters (and optionally out to 20 meters depth). These samples are then processed (the organisms are isolated) and then analyzed and catalogued. The information (regarding the kind and number of organisms analyzed) is sent to the global headquarters of NaGISA- the University of Kyoto in Japan. All of this information is then collated on the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS website). The end goal of the larger CoML effort is to find what \"was\", what \"is\", and what \"will be\" in the world's oceans. For NaGISA the goal is to find this in the world's in-shore areas.",

When the bodyboarder detaches completely from the wave surface or the lip the trick is called an \"air roll\" or \"aerial roll\". Other variations include the \"barrel roll\" where the roll is completed inside the barrel, and the \"rollo takeoff\" which is performed while catching the wave. This trick was named by someone in the industry. I remember the story where Pat Caldwell did the roll and Jack Lindholm or whoever saw him do it and commented \"what do you call that an el rollo\".

            "Work college\nWork colleges are distinctive liberal arts colleges in the United States that promote the purposeful integration of work, learning, and service. At a work college all students work regardless of their academic program or their financial need. A work college is a public or private non-profit, four-year degree-granting institution of higher learning where student work is an integrated, essential and federally required core component of the educational work-learning-service program. Unlike Federal Work Study, which is solely need-based, work colleges do not differentiate between those that can afford to pay for their education from those that must work to cover their educational costs. At work colleges, students are regularly evaluated and assessed on their work performance and can be dismissed from the institution for non-performance in the work program. Students do not have the ability to \"buy\" their way out of the work requirement. Students perform essential institutional functions in every area imaginable on their campuses and gain a strong sense of ownership and responsibility for their campus community. Student labor enables work colleges to be far more operationally efficient and administratively lean (compared to more traditional colleges). This, in turn, contributes to lower operational costs which results in lower \u2013 and more affordable \u2013 tuition.",

Beauford graduated from Palatka High School in Palatka, Florida in 1981. He played college football for Auburn University from 1981 to 1984. In October 1982, he scored a touchdown on a 60-yard pass play against Georgia Tech. In 1984, he was the subject of an investigation in which it was alleged that his high school records had been altered to allow him to attend Auburn on a football scholarship. The principal, assistant principal, a masonry teacher and another person at the high school were later charged with official misconduct, filing false reports, or perjury in the matter. Beauford was drafted by the Detroit Lions but spent the 1985 season on the injury list after sustaining a broken kneecap in the 1985 Senior Bowl. He was released by the Lions in August 1986.

            "See Yourself\n\"See Yourself\" is a song by English musician George Harrison, released on his 1976 album \"Thirty Three & 1/3\". Harrison began writing the song in 1967, while he was a member of the Beatles, in response to the public outcry surrounding bandmate Paul McCartney's admission that he had taken the hallucinogenic drug LSD. McCartney's announcement created a reaction in the press similar to that caused in 1966 by John Lennon's statement that the Beatles were more popular than Christianity. In its finished form, the song's lyrics advocate self-awareness and consideration for the consequences of one's actions. Musically, the composition contains unusual shifts in time signature from standard 4/4 to 9/8, while the songwords reflect the era of its genesis by recalling themes first espoused in the Beatles tracks \"Within You Without You\" and \"All You Need Is Love\".",

The Browns finished with a 4\u201312 record and failed to qualify for the playoffs. The season marked Romeo Crennel's fourth (and what would be final) year as head coach of the Browns. Cleveland played all of their home games at Cleveland Browns Stadium in Cleveland, Ohio. In the 2008 season, the Browns failed to score a touchdown for 24 consecutive quarters. Also from 2008 to present, the Browns have failed to obtain a winning record, thus they failed to make the playoffs for the seventh straight season.",

The Browns failed to improve upon their 3\u201313 record from their previous season, finishing 1\u201315, their worst record in franchise history. They started the season 0\u201314, their worst 14-game start in franchise history, and in so doing, clinched a losing record for a franchise record ninth straight season, failed to make the playoffs for a franchise record 14th straight season, finished in fourth place in the AFC North for the sixth straight season, went 0\u20136 within the division, failed to win a road game in a season for only the second time in franchise history (first occurred during the 1975 season), and set a franchise record for most consecutive losses, losing 17 straight games going back to their final three games of the previous season. They also extended their road losing streak to 13 games, a streak that began in Week 7 of the 2015 season, when they lost their final five road games. The Browns were also the first team to start 0\u201314 since the Detroit Lions went winless during 2008, the first team to finish with a 1\u201315 record since 2009, and only the 10th team in NFL history to finish with 15 losses. The Browns' lone victory was a 20\u201317 win over the San Diego Chargers in Week 16.",

The Lions qualified for their first postseason appearance since 1970. The NFL changed the playoff format due to the strike. The Lions became one of only four teams to ever qualify for the playoffs despite having a losing record. The Lions and the 1982 Cleveland Browns are the only two teams with a losing record to qualify as wildcards. In 2010, the Seattle Seahawks became the third team with a losing record to qualify for the playoffs and the first team to win a division title with a losing record (however, the Seahawks accomplished the former in a full-length season). The Lions lost to the Washington Redskins at RFK Stadium in the first round of the playoffs.",

The team's co-captains were halfback Bob Hoernschemeyer and defensive tackle John Prchlik, and defensive end Jim Doran was selected as the team's most valuable player. In their third year under head coach Buddy Parker, the 1952 Lions compiled a 9\u20133 record during the regular season, finished in a tie with the Los Angeles Rams for first place in the NFL's National Conference, defeated the Rams in a tiebreaker game, and defeated the Cleveland Browns, 17\u20137, in the 1953 NFL Championship Game at Municipal Stadium in Cleveland.",

The Lions entered their third season under head coach Rod Marinelli and were looking to improve on the 7\u20139 record they put together in 2007. Instead, the Lions had one of the worst seasons in pro sports history. The team lost all sixteen of their games in 2008, becoming the first team since the 1976 Tampa Bay Buccaneers to end an NFL season with no wins and no tied games as well as the first and only team to do it since the schedule was expanded to sixteen games. The Lions were mathematically eliminated from the playoffs by Week 11, when they stood 0\u201310. The team's victory over the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 16 of 2007 stood as their last until Week 3 of the 2009 season. From the time the Lions recorded a win over the Denver Broncos in 2007 to reach 6\u20132, the team went 5\u201347 over their following 52 games (including all of 2008 and 2009) before winning four games in a row at the end of the 2010 season. As of 2017, this is the only team in NFL history to finish a season with a 0\u201316 record. The 2016 Cleveland Browns and the 2009 St. Louis Rams came close to 0\u201316, both going 1\u201315.",

            "Cleveland Browns relocation controversy\nThe Cleveland Browns relocation controversy, sometimes referred to by fans as \"The Move\", was the decision by then-Browns owner Art Modell to relocate the National Football League (NFL)'s Cleveland Browns from its long-time home of Cleveland to Baltimore during the 1995 NFL season. Subsequent legal actions by the city of Cleveland and Browns season ticket holders led the NFL to broker a compromise that saw the Browns history, records, and intellectual property remain in Cleveland. In return, Modell was permitted to move his football organization to Baltimore where he established the Baltimore Ravens. The Ravens are officially regarded by the NFL as an expansion team that began play in . The city of Cleveland agreed to demolish Cleveland Stadium and build a new stadium on the same site, and the NFL agreed to reactivate the Browns by the 1999 season through either an expansion draft or a relocated franchise. The Browns were officially reactivated in 1998 through the expansion process and resumed play in 1999.",

The Browns finished with a 4\u201312 record and failed to qualify for the playoffs. The season marked Romeo Crennel's fourth (and what would be final) year as head coach of the Browns. Cleveland played all of their home games at Cleveland Browns Stadium in Cleveland, Ohio. In the 2008 season, the Browns failed to score a touchdown for 24 consecutive quarters. Also from 2008 to present, the Browns have failed to obtain a winning record, thus they failed to make the playoffs for the seventh straight season.",
            "2016 Cleveland Browns season\nThe 2016 Cleveland Browns season was the franchise's 68th season as a professional sports franchise, its 64th as a member of the National Football League and its first under head coach Hue Jackson and de facto general manager Sashi Brown. The Browns failed to improve upon their 3\u201313 record from their previous season, finishing 1\u201315, their worst record in franchise history. They started the season 0\u201314, their worst 14-game start in franchise history, and in so doing, clinched a losing record for a franchise record ninth straight season, failed to make the playoffs for a franchise record 14th straight season, finished in fourth place in the AFC North for the sixth straight season, went 0\u20136 within the division, failed to win a road game in a season for only the second time in franchise history (first occurred during the 1975 season), and set a franchise record for most consecutive losses, losing 17 straight games going back to their final three games of the previous season. They also extended their road losing streak to 13 games, a streak that began in Week 7 of the 2015 season, when they lost their final five road games. The Browns were also the first team to start 0\u201314 since the Detroit Lions went winless during 2008, the first team to finish with a 1\u201315 record since 2009, and only the 10th team in NFL history to finish with 15 losses. The Browns' lone victory was a 20\u201317 win over the San Diego Chargers in Week 16.",

The Lions qualified for their first postseason appearance since 1970. The NFL changed the playoff format due to the strike. The Lions became one of only four teams to ever qualify for the playoffs despite having a losing record. The Lions and the 1982 Cleveland Browns are the only two teams with a losing record to qualify as wildcards. In 2010, the Seattle Seahawks became the third team with a losing record to qualify for the playoffs and the first team to win a division title with a losing record (however, the Seahawks accomplished the former in a full-length season). The Lions lost to the Washington Redskins at RFK Stadium in the first round of the playoffs.",

Instead, the Lions had one of the worst seasons in pro sports history.

The Lions were mathematically eliminated from the playoffs by Week 11, when they stood 0\u201310. The team's victory over the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 16 of 2007 stood as their last until Week 3 of the 2009 season. From the time the Lions recorded a win over the Denver Broncos in 2007 to reach 6\u20132, the team went 5\u201347 over their following 52 games (including all of 2008 and 2009) before winning four games in a row at the end of the 2010 season. As of 2017, this is the only team in NFL history to finish a season with a 0\u201316 record. The 2016 Cleveland Browns and the 2009 St. Louis Rams came close to 0\u201316, both going 1\u201315.",

            "Cleveland Browns relocation controversy\nThe Cleveland Browns relocation controversy, sometimes referred to by fans as \"The Move\", was the decision by then-Browns owner Art Modell to relocate the National Football League (NFL)'s Cleveland Browns from its long-time home of Cleveland to Baltimore during the 1995 NFL season. Subsequent legal actions by the city of Cleveland and Browns season ticket holders led the NFL to broker a compromise that saw the Browns history, records, and intellectual property remain in Cleveland. In return, Modell was permitted to move his football organization to Baltimore where he established the Baltimore Ravens. The Ravens are officially regarded by the NFL as an expansion team that began play in . The city of Cleveland agreed to demolish Cleveland Stadium and build a new stadium on the same site, and the NFL agreed to reactivate the Browns by the 1999 season through either an expansion draft or a relocated franchise. The Browns were officially reactivated in 1998 through the expansion process and resumed play in 1999.",
