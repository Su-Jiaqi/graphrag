As Coen later described it in an interview, he did not know anything about subtitling at the time, and learned on the job: I finally got a phone call from London Films, Sir Cunnyngham, that 's it, who asked me whether I had ever subtitles pictures. I immediately said I had when in point of fact I did not know what he meant, and there was a young man in the office with Sir David Cunnynghame called Lew Watt, and he said Lew Watt will do the technical side and we want you to subtitle an Italian picture in to English. I said certainly . I came out of his office and Lew Watt said to me you don't know what they're talking about do you, I said you're quite right, he said well I'll show you. And I started subtitling pictures with Lew Watt, I used to do the literary side, and he used to do the technical side, the spotting, and lengths, and we together did subtitles for 40 or 50 pictures. The funny thing was we subtitled pictures in Chinese, in Indian and for the Chinese picture I had to have a Chinese waiter with me to tell me where the subtitles [...] I had the Italian dialogue and I had the picture, they gave me a film and we did the spotting together with Lew Watt and the measurements and I used to type the script. We had the film, we had the print which used to run on the two sided thing. And Lew Watt was working all the day so we had to do this at night, so we either used to work at night till 2 o'clock in the morning or we used to work at the weekends.

Warren Buffett's first wife, Susan Thompson Buffett, was also active in philanthropy and was a director of Berkshire Hathaway.",
                "Key principles and practices of Warren Buffett include value investing, which involves identifying undervalued stocks and holding them for the long term.

                "Owner earnings is a concept popularized by Warren Buffett, which refers to the actual cash that a business generates for its owners. It is calculated by taking the net income of the company and adding back non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization, as well as deducting any capital expenditures necessary to maintain the business. This concept is used to determine the true profitability and value of a business for its owners.",
                "Owner earnings can be broken down into several components:\n\n1. Net Income: This is the total profit of the company after all expenses, including taxes and interest, have been deducted.\n\n2. Non-cash expenses: These are expenses that do not involve the actual outflow of cash, such as depreciation and amortization. These expenses are added back to the net income to reflect the actual cash generated by the business.\n\n3. Capital expenditures: These are the expenses required to maintain the business, such as purchasing new equipment or investing in infrastructure. These expenses are deducted from the net income to reflect the cash that is necessary to sustain the business.\n\nThe formula for calculating owner earnings is:\n\nOwner Earnings = Net Income + Non-cash expenses - Capital Expenditures\n\nBy using this formula, investors and business owners can get a clearer picture of the actual cash flow and profitability of a business, which can be used to determine the true value of the business for its owners. This concept is particularly useful for evaluating the performance of a business and making investment decisions.",
                "Common activities and principles between 'Owner earnings' and Warren Buffett's investment activities include a focus on long-term value and sustainability. Both emphasize the importance of understanding the true cash flow and profitability of a business, as opposed to solely relying on accounting profits. Additionally, both 'Owner earnings' and Buffett's investment approach prioritize transparency, ethical business practices, and a commitment to long-term success. Both also involve a careful analysis of a company's fundamentals and competitive advantage, as well as a disciplined approach to investing. Overall, the principles of 'Owner earnings' and Warren Buffett's investment activities align in their emphasis on long-term value, transparency, and a focus on the underlying cash flow and profitability of a business."

At each site throughout the world, samples are taken from the intertidal zone out to a depth of 10 meters (and optionally out to 20 meters depth). These samples are then processed (the organisms are isolated) and then analyzed and catalogued. The information (regarding the kind and number of organisms analyzed) is sent to the global headquarters of NaGISA- the University of Kyoto in Japan.

So named for the Japanese word \"nagisa\" (\"where the land meets the sea\"), it is an Apronym. NaGISA is the first project of the larger CoML effort (Census of Marine Life) to have global participation in actual field work. The actual procedures of this project involve inexpensive collection equipment (for easy universal participation). This equipment is used to photograph sampling sites, to actually take samples from the sites, and to process these samples. At each site throughout the world, samples are taken from the intertidal zone out to a depth of 10 meters (and optionally out to 20 meters depth). These samples are then processed (the organisms are isolated) and then analyzed and catalogued. The information (regarding the kind and number of organisms analyzed) is sent to the global headquarters of NaGISA- the University of Kyoto in Japan. All of this information is then collated on the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS website). The end goal of the larger CoML effort is to find what \"was\", what \"is\", and what \"will be\" in the world's oceans. For NaGISA the goal is to find this in the world's in-shore areas.",
                "Memory of Mankind\nSeveral motivations underlie the project. The primary ambition of MOM is to preserve an image of our era, created by numerous participants all over the planet. MOM will also contain information which our society is obliged to forward to the future: e.g. description of nuclear waste repositories. MOM collaborates with the NEA and SKB. Although the most obvious ambition and often described in the media is the concern about preserving our knowledge, this is not the primary goal of MOM. Serving as a time capsule MOM is both: in a time frame of millennia it is the story about us, and in a time frame of decades it is a backup. In times where global warming, nuclear danger and biological warfare threaten the existence of civilization, saving the core knowledge and culture acquired over centuries is a backup measure. In case of a collapse, the MOM project could help survivors to rebuild civilization. Linked to this, an another reason is of political order: facing the lack of reactivity of authorities concerning global warming, the MOM project is a reminder of what can happen. Roman and Greek civilizations whose histories have been reconstructed by the small percentage of texts and artifacts which survived until our days are examples that have inspired the MOM project. Finally, it's a critic of our digital civilization : according to Kunze, maybe nothing of the 21st century will last in the future, since most of our interactions are now virtual. The \"accuracy versus bullshit\" is one of the main themes of the MOM project, worried about loss of information, the project can only aim to save a fragment of the information produced until today, but this fragment has to be representative.",

This is usually in the form of a number followed by a letter suffix, though other 'non-standard' codes are also used. This code describes to employers how much tax to deduct from an employee. The code is normally based on information provided to HMRC by the taxpayer or their employer. Tax codes are usually adjusted once a year to take into account any changes made in the National Budget, but can be altered more often to reflect an employee's circumstances. Tax codes can be changed if someone has paid too much or too little tax the previous tax year, if an employee receives state benefits, or has non-PAYE income (for example, self-employed earnings). Changes in a tax code are to ensure the employee has paid the correct amount of tax by the end of each tax year.",

                "Owner earnings is a concept introduced by Warren Buffett in 1986 as a valuation method for determining the true value of a company. It involves calculating the net cash flows expected to occur over the life of the business, minus any reinvestment of earnings. This method focuses on the cash flows available to the owner, rather than just looking at reported earnings or accounting profits.\n\nTypical activities associated with owner earnings include:\n\n1. Cash flow analysis: This involves analyzing the cash flows generated by the business, including operating cash flows, investing cash flows, and financing cash flows. Understanding the cash flow dynamics of the business is essential for calculating owner earnings.\n\n2. Reinvestment assessment: Evaluating the amount of earnings that need to be reinvested back into the business to sustain and grow its operations. This involves assessing capital expenditures, research and development expenses, and other investments required to maintain and expand the business.\n\n3. Long-term forecasting: Projecting the future cash flows of the business over the long term to estimate the owner earnings. This may involve considering factors such as industry trends, market conditions, and competitive dynamics.\n\n4. Discounted cash flow analysis: Applying a discount rate to the projected owner earnings to determine the present value of these cash flows. This helps in assessing the intrinsic value of the business and making investment decisions.\n\n5. Financial reporting adjustments: Making adjustments to the reported earnings and financial statements to reflect the true economic earnings available to the owner. This may involve accounting for non-cash expenses, one-time charges, and other distortions in reported earnings.\n\nOverall, owner earnings analysis involves a comprehensive assessment of the cash flows available to the owner of the business, taking into account the reinvestment needs and long-term prospects of the company. It provides a more accurate and realistic measure of the value of a business compared to traditional accounting metrics.",

It is calculated by taking the net income of a company and adding back non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization, as well as deducting any capital expenditures necessary to maintain the business. This concept is used to determine the true profitability and value of a business for its owners.",
                "The key components of owner earnings include net income, non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization, and capital expenditures. Net income is the starting point, and non-cash expenses are added back to reflect the actual cash generated by the business. Capital expenditures are then deducted to account for the investment needed to maintain the business.\n\nThe uses of owner earnings include determining the true profitability and value of a business for its owners. By focusing on the cash generated for the owners, rather than just the accounting profit, owner earnings provide a more accurate measure of a business's performance and its ability to generate returns for its owners. This concept is particularly popular among value investors, such as Warren Buffett, who prioritize cash flow and profitability when evaluating investment opportunities.",
