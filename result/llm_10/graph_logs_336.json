It was a major critical success, becoming the only Rolling Stones album to be nominated for a Grammy in the Album of the Year category. Many reviewers called it a classic return to form and their best album since 1972's \"Exile on Main St.\"",
                "Aftermath (The Rolling Stones album)\nAftermath, released in April 1966 by Decca Records, is the fourth British studio album by the Rolling Stones. It was issued in the United States in June 1966 by London Records as the group's sixth American album. The album is considered an artistic breakthrough for the band: it is the first to consist entirely of Mick Jagger\u2013Keith Richards compositions, while Brian Jones played a variety of instruments not usually associated with their music, including sitar, Appalachian dulcimer, marimbas and Japanese koto, as well as guitar, harmonica and keyboards, though much of the music is still rooted in Chicago electric blues. It was the first Rolling Stones album to be recorded entirely in the US, at the RCA Studios in California, and their first album released in true stereo. It is also one of the earliest rock albums to eclipse the 50-minute mark, and contains one of the earliest rock songs to eclipse the 10-minute mark (\"Goin' Home\").",
                "It's Only Rock 'n Roll\nIt's Only Rock 'n Roll is the 12th British and 14th American studio album by The Rolling Stones, released in 1974. It was the last Rolling Stones album for guitarist Mick Taylor and the songwriting and recording of the album's title track had a connection to Taylor's eventual replacement, Ronnie Wood. The album also marked the 10th anniversary since the release of the band's debut album, \"The Rolling Stones\". \"It's Only Rock 'n Roll\" has a firmer rock sound than the band's previous album, the more funk - and soul - inspired \"Goats Head Soup\". \"It's Only Rock 'n Roll\" reached #1 in the US and #2 in the UK."
