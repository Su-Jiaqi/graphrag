NaGISA is the first project of the larger CoML effort (Census of Marine Life) to have global participation in actual field work. The actual procedures of this project involve inexpensive collection equipment (for easy universal participation). This equipment is used to photograph sampling sites, to actually take samples from the sites, and to process these samples. At each site throughout the world, samples are taken from the intertidal zone out to a depth of 10 meters (and optionally out to 20 meters depth). These samples are then processed (the organisms are isolated) and then analyzed and catalogued. The information (regarding the kind and number of organisms analyzed) is sent to the global headquarters of NaGISA- the University of Kyoto in Japan. All of this information is then collated on the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS website). The end goal of the larger CoML effort is to find what \"was\", what \"is\", and what \"will be\" in the world's oceans. For NaGISA the goal is to find this in the world's in-shore areas.",

The most common conventions are based upon industry, profession, and fandom. Trade conventions typically focus on a particular industry or industry segment, and feature keynote speakers, vendor displays, and other information and activities of interest to the event organizers and attendees. Professional conventions focus on issues of concern to the profession and advancements in the profession. Such conventions are generally organized by societies or communities dedicated to promotion of the topic of interest. Fan conventions usually feature displays, shows, and sales based on pop culture and guest celebrities. Science fiction conventions traditionally partake of the nature of both professional conventions and fan conventions, with the balance varying from one to another. Conventions also exist for various hobbies, such as gaming or model railroads."

When Two Cities was absorbed into the Rank Organisation in the mid-1940s Coen was employed by Sir David Cunynghame of London Film Productions as a subtitler. As Coen later described it in an interview, he did not know anything about subtitling at the time, and learned on the job: I finally got a phone call from London Films, Sir Cunnyngham, that 's it, who asked me whether I had ever subtitles pictures. I immediately said I had when in point of fact I did not know what he meant, and there was a young man in the office with Sir David Cunnynghame called Lew Watt, and he said Lew Watt will do the technical side and we want you to subtitle an Italian picture in to English. I said certainly . I came out of his office and Lew Watt said to me you don't know what they're talking about do you, I said you're quite right, he said well I'll show you. And I started subtitling pictures with Lew Watt, I used to do the literary side, and he used to do the technical side, the spotting, and lengths, and we together did subtitles for 40 or 50 pictures. The funny thing was we subtitled pictures in Chinese, in Indian and for the Chinese picture I had to have a Chinese waiter with me to tell me where the subtitles [...] I had the Italian dialogue and I had the picture, they gave me a film and we did the spotting together with Lew Watt and the measurements and I used to type the script. We had the film, we had the print which used to run on the two sided thing. And Lew Watt was working all the day so we had to do this at night, so we either used to work at night till 2 o'clock in the morning or we used to work at the weekends. There was always the problem that the Movieola might break down and so we had spare keys of other cutting rooms in in elm St in case we were caught. And that was how we started.Coen later founded his own company Kenilworth Film Productions and spent most of the post-war years producing second features. He made a dozen films in partnership with the director Charles Saunders. He later produced the 1971 horror film \"Burke & Hare\" and the comedies \"Au Pair Girls\" and \"Intimate Games.\"",

                "Horace Ov\u00e9 is a British filmmaker, photographer, painter, and writer, born in 1939. He is considered one of the leading black independent filmmakers in Britain since the post-war period. Ov\u00e9 holds the Guinness World Record for being the first black British filmmaker to direct a feature-length film, \"Pressure\" in 1975. His work provides a perspective on the Black experience in Britain and he is considered a pioneer in Black British history.\n\nOv\u00e9's son, Zak Ov\u00e9, is a British visual artist who works in sculpture, film, and photography. His work reflects his interest in diasporic and African history, particularly through Trinidadian carnival, and has been exhibited internationally.\n\nHorace Ov\u00e9 directed the first feature-length fiction film by a Black filmmaker in Britain, \"Pressure,\" which portrays inter-generational tensions between first- and second-generation West Indian migrants in London's Notting Hill area. He also directed the television serial \"The Orchid House\" and the TV comedy film \"Playing Away.\"\n\nIn addition to his work as a filmmaker, Ov\u00e9 has also been involved in the public radio show and podcast interview series \"Here's the Thing,\" hosted by actor Alec Baldwin.\n\nOverall, Horace Ov\u00e9 has made significant contributions to the film industry and has been a trailblazer for black filmmakers in Britain.",
                "Based on the information provided, Horace Ov\u00e9's biography does not explicitly mention photography as his profession or activity. The focus is primarily on his work as a filmmaker and his contributions to the film industry. While his son, Zak Ov\u00e9, is mentioned as a visual artist working in sculpture, film, and photography, there is no indication that Horace Ov\u00e9 himself is primarily known for his work in photography. Therefore, it can be inferred that photography is not a prominent aspect of his professional career.",
