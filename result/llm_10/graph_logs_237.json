The playing time is set by agreement from all players, e.g. 2 hours, and the winner is determined by the monetary sum of all player cash, companies, insurance or other assets. The game can also end when there are no more companies, advertisements in the bank or bonds in the treasury. Another objective of the game is \"to teach players some of the fundamentals of economics, and the ways in which the economy and the government interact.\" Different editions were published for several different countries. The name \"Poleconomy\" is a portmanteau of \"politics\" and \"economy\".",

The \"wild card\" is announced before the hand is dealt and can be substituted for any card in the deck according to what is most beneficial to the player's hand. Since the game uses a standard deck, there are always four \"wild cards\" in play. This allows the player greater flexibility in building a winning hand.",

                "Pandemic (board game)\nPandemic is a cooperative board game designed by Matt Leacock and published by Z-Man Games in 2007. \"Pandemic\" is based on the premise that four diseases have broken out in the world, each threatening to wipe out a region. The game accommodates 2 to 4 players, each playing one of five possible specialists: dispatcher, medic, scientist, researcher, or operations expert. The game is unlike most board games in that the gameplay is cooperative, rather than competitive. Through the combined effort of all the players, the goal is to discover all four cures before any of several game-losing conditions are reached.",

                "Trouble (board game)\nTrouble (known as Frustration in the UK and Kimble in Finland) is a board game in which players compete to be the first to send four pieces all the way around a board. Pieces are moved according to the roll of a die. \"Trouble\" was developed by the Kohner Brothers and initially manufactured by Irwin Toy Ltd., later by Milton Bradley (now part of Hasbro). The game was launched in the United States in 1965. It is very similar to the much older game, \"Mensch \u00e4rgere dich nicht\", as well as another Hasbro game, \"Sorry!\" (originally marketed by Parker Brothers). The classic version is now marketed by Winning Moves. All these games are versions of the classic Indian game Pachisi, which was first introduced to the western world in England under the name of \"Ludo\"."
