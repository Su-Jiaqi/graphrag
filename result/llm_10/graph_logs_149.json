                "Postpipe\nIn archaeology, a postpipe (or post pipe) is the remains of an upright timber placed in a posthole. Given the right conditions, timbers may survive over long periods of time and a recovered postpipe can simply be of solid wood. Under less preservative conditions however, only a dark circular stain of organic material may be left in the fill of the posthole observable in plan and section. This differs in consistency from the less organic backfill of the posthole and can be identified simply through this change in make-up. The size and depth and of the postpipe can provide information as to any reuse of the posthole especially if several different postpipes can be identified. They can also indicate the species of wood used and help suggest the nature of the structure that the timber once supported. The term was first used by Maud Cunnington when she excavated the site of Woodhenge in the English county of Wiltshire during the 1920s and found numerous examples of decomposed timber posts.",

                "Lifestyle trends and media\nLifestyle changes have been increasing slowly since the introduction of media. Media \u2013 films, television shows, magazines, and more recently, the Internet (i.e. self-written blogs and popular websites) are the main sources of lifestyle influence around the world. Lifestyle changes include how people eat, dress, and communicate. Celebrity endorsements are prevalent. Lifestyle trends have always been influenced by the wealthy and famous, whether they are spotted at leisure or in a paid advertisement. At the dawn of the media age, the newspaper, popular magazines like \"Life\", and TV allowed the general public glimpse lifestyles that before were only available to the imagination. After its creation, the Internet became arguably the most powerful medium for spotting and influencing trends, not just by celebrities but by the average person. The computer era has changed the way people obtain their news, perspectives and communication. Magazines are still popular, but advertisers now often supply a web address where consumers can visit for more information than a print ad can provide. The average American household has two personal computers, making the Internet easily accessible. The rise of user-generated content is exemplified by the fact that anyone with Internet access can create a blog or an online journal, whether personal or commercial, which might detail someone's experience in a new restaurant, a purchased item of clothing or knickknack, or a review to a film. With the advent of the Android phone and its relative ease of uploading photos to social media sites such as Facebook, one can get an idea of how quickly an idea, pub review, or coveted object can be shared. Advertisers have always been privy to the strength of word-of-mouth and have tapped into social media, including Facebook, Twitter, and Tumblr to make their wares known. Douglas Kellner writes, \"Radio, television, film, and the other products of media culture provide materials out of which we forge our very identities; our sense of selfhood; our notion of what it means to be male or female; our sense of class, of ethnicity and race, of nationality, of sexuality; and of \"us\" and \"them.\"\"",

From its founding in 1805 until 1866, the dynasty followed the imperial Ottoman practice of agnatic seniority, whereby the eldest male in any generation would succeed to the throne. In 1866, however, the then Khedive of Egypt Isma'il Pasha obtained a \"firman\" from the Ottoman Emperor which restricted the succession to the male-line descendants of Isma'il Pasha.

First created by King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) in 1886, for his son Prince Maha Vajirunhis, the king's eldest son by a royal wife Queen Savang Vadhana. Prior to this, the Siamese throne did not have a law or formal system regulating the royal succession. In 1688 King Petracha of Ayutthaya created the title of Front Palace, which by the Rattanakosin period had become the main title granted to the heir presumptive to the throne. However few Front Palaces have succeeded to the throne this way, with the exception of King Buddha Loetla Nabhalai (Rama II) in 1809. After the Front Palace crisis in 1875, the title of Front Palace was abolished and replaced with the title of Crown Prince, who became heir apparent to the throne.",

                "Memory of Mankind\nSeveral motivations underlie the project. The primary ambition of MOM is to preserve an image of our era, created by numerous participants all over the planet. MOM will also contain information which our society is obliged to forward to the future: e.g. description of nuclear waste repositories. MOM collaborates with the NEA and SKB. Although the most obvious ambition and often described in the media is the concern about preserving our knowledge, this is not the primary goal of MOM. Serving as a time capsule MOM is both: in a time frame of millennia it is the story about us, and in a time frame of decades it is a backup. In times where global warming, nuclear danger and biological warfare threaten the existence of civilization, saving the core knowledge and culture acquired over centuries is a backup measure. In case of a collapse, the MOM project could help survivors to rebuild civilization. Linked to this, an another reason is of political order: facing the lack of reactivity of authorities concerning global warming, the MOM project is a reminder of what can happen. Roman and Greek civilizations whose histories have been reconstructed by the small percentage of texts and artifacts which survived until our days are examples that have inspired the MOM project. Finally, it's a critic of our digital civilization : according to Kunze, maybe nothing of the 21st century will last in the future, since most of our interactions are now virtual. The \"accuracy versus bullshit\" is one of the main themes of the MOM project, worried about loss of information, the project can only aim to save a fragment of the information produced until today, but this fragment has to be representative.",

Further research into the theoretical characterizations of human\u2013machine interaction led to developments like \"the Model Human Processor, the GOMS theory of user interaction, information foraging theory, and statistical descriptions of Internet use\".

                "Work college\nWork colleges are distinctive liberal arts colleges in the United States that promote the purposeful integration of work, learning, and service. At a work college all students work regardless of their academic program or their financial need. A work college is a public or private non-profit, four-year degree-granting institution of higher learning where student work is an integrated, essential and federally required core component of the educational work-learning-service program. Unlike Federal Work Study, which is solely need-based, work colleges do not differentiate between those that can afford to pay for their education from those that must work to cover their educational costs. At work colleges, students are regularly evaluated and assessed on their work performance and can be dismissed from the institution for non-performance in the work program. Students do not have the ability to \"buy\" their way out of the work requirement. Students perform essential institutional functions in every area imaginable on their campuses and gain a strong sense of ownership and responsibility for their campus community. Student labor enables work colleges to be far more operationally efficient and administratively lean (compared to more traditional colleges). This, in turn, contributes to lower operational costs which results in lower \u2013 and more affordable \u2013 tuition.",

                "See Yourself\n\"See Yourself\" is a song by English musician George Harrison, released on his 1976 album \"Thirty Three & 1/3\". Harrison began writing the song in 1967, while he was a member of the Beatles, in response to the public outcry surrounding bandmate Paul McCartney's admission that he had taken the hallucinogenic drug LSD. McCartney's announcement created a reaction in the press similar to that caused in 1966 by John Lennon's statement that the Beatles were more popular than Christianity. In its finished form, the song's lyrics advocate self-awareness and consideration for the consequences of one's actions. Musically, the composition contains unusual shifts in time signature from standard 4/4 to 9/8, while the songwords reflect the era of its genesis by recalling themes first espoused in the Beatles tracks \"Within You Without You\" and \"All You Need Is Love\".",

This decision was driven by the desire to consolidate power and control over the Kingdom of Majorca, and to assert authority over the region. The abolition of the Consell was a political move aimed at strengthening the authority of the Spanish monarchy and centralizing governance.\n\nOn the other hand, the resumption of the throne in Bangladesh in 1991 was the result of a popular uprising against President Hussain Mohammad Ershad. The 11th amendment to the constitution had been made during Ershad's presidency, and the resumption of democracy led to the return of Shahabuddin Ahmed to his duties as the Chief Justice and later as the President. This event was driven by the desire for democratic governance and the rejection of authoritarian rule, reflecting the political will of the people.\n\nIn both cases, the political factors played a significant role in shaping the events. The abolition of the Consell was a result of the centralization efforts of the Spanish monarchy, while the resumption of the throne in Bangladesh was a response to the popular demand for democracy and the rejection of authoritarian rule. These events demonstrate the complex interplay of political, social, and historical factors in shaping the governance and leadership of a region."

                "The dissolution of the Gran i General Consell in 1718 by Philip V, empowered by the Nova Planta Decree of Majorca and Ibiza, marked a significant political change in the Kingdom of Majorca. This event led to the abolition of all other separate Majorcan institutions as well. Around the same time, in 1718, the title of Earl Cowper was created in the Peerage of Great Britain by George I for William Cowper, 1st Baron Cowper, his first Lord Chancellor. Additionally, Rev James Menteath, who was born around the same time, went on to become a Scottish clergyman of the Church of England and a friend of Adam Smith. These events reflect the political and historical changes that were occurring in Europe during the early 18th century.",
                "The events that led to the resumption of the throne by the man identified in node 1 are not provided in the relevant information. Therefore, further research is needed to determine the specific events that led to his return to the throne.",
                "The individual in question is King Charles II of England, who resumed the throne in 1660 after the period of the English Civil War and the rule of Oliver Cromwell. Charles II's return to the throne was a result of the Restoration, a political and social movement that sought to restore the monarchy after the period of republican rule under Cromwell. The Restoration was supported by a significant portion of the English population who were disillusioned with the strict Puritan rule and longed for the stability and tradition of the monarchy. Additionally, Charles II's personal popularity and his promises of religious tolerance and political amnesty also contributed to his successful return to power. Overall, the historical context of the Restoration and the desire for stability and tradition played a significant role in Charles II's resumption of the throne."

                "Stuart Card\nStuart K. Card (born c. 1946), an American researcher and Senior Research Fellow at Xerox PARC, is considered to be one of the pioneers of applying human factors in human\u2013computer interaction. His study of input devices led to the Fitts's Law characterization of the computer mouse and was a major factor leading to the mouse's commercial introduction by Xerox, most notably in the Alto and Star projects, some of the very earliest GUI systems employing a desktop metaphor. The 1983 book \"The Psychology of Human-Computer Interaction\", which he co-wrote with Thomas P. Moran and Allen Newell, became seminal work in the HCI field. Further research into the theoretical characterizations of human\u2013machine interaction led to developments like \"the Model Human Processor, the GOMS theory of user interaction, information foraging theory, and statistical descriptions of Internet use\". In the new millennium his research has been focusing on developing a \"supporting science of human\u2013information interaction and visual-semantic prototypes to aid sense making\".",
                "Controversies surrounding Grand Theft Auto V\n\"Grand Theft Auto V\" is an open world, action-adventure video game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games. Upon its 17 September 2013 release on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, the game generated controversies related to its violence and depiction of women. A mission that requires players to use torture equipment in a hostage interrogation polarised reviewers, who noted its political commentary but felt that the torture sequence was in poor taste. The mission also received criticism from politicians and anti-torture charity groups. The game became subject to widespread online debate over its portrayal of women, particularly in the wake of backlash against GameSpot journalist Carolyn Petit after she claimed the game was misogynystic in her review. After Petit's review webpage received more than 20,000 largely negative comments, many journalists defended her right to an opinion and lamented the gaming community's defensiveness towards criticism. Television personality Karen Gravano and actress Lindsay Lohan both filed lawsuits against Rockstar in allegation that characters in the game were based on their likenesses. Target's Australian division pulled the game from their 300 stores following a Change.org petition that claimed the game \"encourages players to commit sexual violence and kill women\", despite the petition being criticised as misleading and portrayals of sexual violence in games already illegal in Australia.",
