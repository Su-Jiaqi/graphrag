                "The Time of Our Time\nThe Time of Our Time is an anthology of Norman Mailer\u2019s various literary works, published by Modern Library in 1998. The work was designed to commemorate both the fiftieth anniversary of \"The Naked and the Dead\" (1948), and Mailer\u2019s seventy-fifth birthday. Norman Mailer edited the anthology himself, choosing to organize the content not by the chronology in which the pieces are written, but the chronology of the events that the works describe; some of the excerpts are written in the midst of the action, while others may come upon forty years of reflection. Selected texts that deal with the ancient world, however, appear out of sequence at the end of the volume. (Mailer\u2019s explanation: \u201cNobody is perfect.\u201d) Excerpts from Mailer\u2019s most notable works, including \"The Naked and the Dead\", \"Advertisements for Myself\" (1959), \"Superman Comes to the Supermarket\" (1960), \"The Armies of the Night\" (1968), \"Miami and the Siege of Chicago\" (1968), \"Of a Fire on the Moon\" (1970), and \"The Executioner's Song\" (1979), as well as several works in their entirety, including \"The White Negro: Superficial Reflections on the Hipster\" (1957), \"The Time of Her Time\" (1959), and various transcribed and annotated interviews with the likes of William F.
