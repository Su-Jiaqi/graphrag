Its success prompted an extension of dates entitled Crazy 2K. The tour was positively received by critics, but generated some controversy due to her racy outfits. Jae-Ha Kim of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" commented that \"Spears has that 'it' factor that worked for pinup queens of the past.\" In 2000\u201301, she performed on the worldwide Oops!... I Did It Again World Tour. It was critically appreciated for Spears' energy and performance, as well as the band. She then followed this with the Dream Within a Dream Tour in 2001\u201302, visiting Japan and Mexico for the first time. The performances were accompanied by many special effects, the \"pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance\" being a water screen that pumped two tons of water onto the stage during the encore performance of \"...Baby One More Time.\" In a show in Miami, Britney stopped the show three songs into the setlist because it was too dangerous to perform in the rain storm.",

The operation was initially planned to be executed in conjunction with Operation Overlord, the Allied landing in the Normandy, but the lack of available resources led to a cancellation of the second landing. By July 1944 the landing was reconsidered, as the clogged-up ports in Normandy did not have the capacity to adequately supply the Allied forces. Concurrently, the French High Command pushed for a revival of the operation that would include large numbers of French troops. As a result, the operation was finally approved in July to be executed in August."

This equipment is used to photograph sampling sites, to actually take samples from the sites, and to process these samples. At each site throughout the world, samples are taken from the intertidal zone out to a depth of 10 meters (and optionally out to 20 meters depth). These samples are then processed (the organisms are isolated) and then analyzed and catalogued. The information (regarding the kind and number of organisms analyzed) is sent to the global headquarters of NaGISA- the University of Kyoto in Japan. All of this information is then collated on the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS website). The end goal of the larger CoML effort is to find what \"was\", what \"is\", and what \"will be\" in the world's oceans. For NaGISA the goal is to find this in the world's in-shore areas.",
