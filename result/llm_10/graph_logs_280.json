Established in 1913, the society maintained some 100 primary schools (mostly one-room schools), 50 evening classes, and Teacher's Seminary in Vilnius (Wilno, Vilna) in 1927.

                "Sharon Gannon\nSharon Gannon (born July 4, 1951 in Washington, D.C.) is a yoga teacher, animal rights advocate, musician, author, dancer/choreographer and painter. Along with David Life, she is the co-founder of the Jivamukti Yoga Method which contributed to the exponential rise in popularity of yoga in the west during the late 20th century. The Jivamukti Yoga Method distinguishes itself as a path to enlightenment by promoting compassion for all beings, challenging the modern belief that enslaving and exploiting animals and the natural world is our right as the dominant species. The Jivamukti Yoga Method teaches its students that they must be willing to promote the happiness of all beings without exception if they wish to realize their fullest capacity for joy. Jivamukti students are encouraged to adopt a diet that eliminates all animal products (vegan) as this is the diet that causes the least amount of harm to the earth and other beings, humans included. Core to the teachings of Jivamukti Yoga is the concept of shunyata or (emptiness) which is found in the ancient yogic scriptures. This idea can be simply stated as: everything you see and experience in the world comes from your perception of it. If you want to change someone or to change the world, you start by changing yourself by changing your views. When you begin to embrace this concept and put it into practice then you cannot find solace in complaining or blaming others. You are freed from seeing yourself as a victim of others or of circumstances. According to Gannon: \"How you treat others will determine how others treat you. How others treat you will determine how you see yourself. How you see yourself will determine who you are.\"",

Established in 1913, the society maintained some 100 primary schools (mostly one-room schools), 50 evening classes, and Teacher's Seminary in Vilnius (Wilno, Vilna) in 1927. Due to political tensions between Poland and Lithuania as well as wider Polonization policies, Rytas faced increasing difficulties and restrictions in maintaining its schools.

As schools were closed, Rytas shifted its focus to maintaining community reading rooms. After the death of J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski in 1935, the rooms were often raided by police and closed.

Established in 1913, the society maintained some 100 primary schools (mostly one-room schools), 50 evening classes, and Teacher's Seminary in Vilnius (Wilno, Vilna) in 1927. Due to political tensions between Poland and Lithuania as well as wider Polonization policies, Rytas faced increasing difficulties and restrictions in maintaining its schools. Similar situation existed with Polish schools in Lithuania (see Lithuanization). The situation continued to worsen as both sides increased restrictions in retribution. As schools were closed, Rytas shifted its focus to maintaining community reading rooms. After the death of J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski in 1935, the rooms were often raided by police and closed. Eventually, the society was abolished by Polish authorities in February 1938. Only the Vytautas the Great Gymnasium was allowed to operate. After the Polish ultimatum of March 1938, diplomatic relations were established between Poland and Lithuania and Rytas was allowed to operate again in May 1939. It could not resume its activities due to World War II and was abolished again soon after the occupation of Lithuania by the Soviet Union in June 1940.

                "The Apple Tree\nThe Apple Tree is a series of three musical playlets with music by Jerry Bock, lyrics by Sheldon Harnick, and a book by Bock and Harnick with contributions from Jerome Coopersmith. Each act has its own storyline, but all three are tied together by a common theme (someone who believes that they want something, but once they get what they wanted they realize that it wasn't what they wanted) and common references, such as references to the color brown. The first act is based on Mark Twain's \"The Diary of Adam and Eve\"; the second act is based on Frank R. Stockton's \"The Lady or the Tiger?\"; the third act is based on Jules Feiffer's \"Passionella\". The working title for the evening of three musicals was \"Come Back! Go Away! I Love You!\"",

His work included designing chateaux, palaces, and other architectural structures, and he was known for his intricate and detailed engravings.",

There is no evidence to suggest that he had any involvement in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth during Henry III's reign.",
