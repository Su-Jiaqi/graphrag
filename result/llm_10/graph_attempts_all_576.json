Their band was called \"Cherie and Marie Currie\". Marie was a guest vocalist on Cherie's first album, so Marie went on tour with Cherie to support her first album, \"Beauty's Only Skin Deep\". When Marie would join Cherie on stage to sing the encores the audience would go wild. So Cherie ran with the idea of two blonds are better than one. The idea paid off because \"Messin' with the Boys\" received more radio play than \"Beauty's Only Skin Deep\", and their song \"Since You Been Gone\" made it to 95 on US charts. The single \"This Time\" and the album Messin' with the Boys made the top 200 on U.S. charts.

As Coen later described it in an interview, he did not know anything about subtitling at the time, and learned on the job: I finally got a phone call from London Films, Sir Cunnyngham, that 's it, who asked me whether I had ever subtitles pictures. I immediately said I had when in point of fact I did not know what he meant, and there was a young man in the office with Sir David Cunnynghame called Lew Watt, and he said Lew Watt will do the technical side and we want you to subtitle an Italian picture in to English. I said certainly . I came out of his office and Lew Watt said to me you don't know what they're talking about do you, I said you're quite right, he said well I'll show you. And I started subtitling pictures with Lew Watt, I used to do the literary side, and he used to do the technical side, the spotting, and lengths, and we together did subtitles for 40 or 50 pictures. The funny thing was we subtitled pictures in Chinese, in Indian and for the Chinese picture I had to have a Chinese waiter with me to tell me where the subtitles [...] I had the Italian dialogue and I had the picture, they gave me a film and we did the spotting together with Lew Watt and the measurements and I used to type the script. We had the film, we had the print which used to run on the two sided thing. And Lew Watt was working all the day so we had to do this at night, so we either used to work at night till 2 o'clock in the morning or we used to work at the weekends. There was always the problem that the Movieola might break down and so we had spare keys of other cutting rooms in in elm St in case we were caught. And that was how we started.Coen later founded his own company Kenilworth Film Productions and spent most of the post-war years producing second features. He made a dozen films in partnership with the director Charles Saunders. He later produced the 1971 horror film \"Burke & Hare\" and the comedies \"Au Pair Girls\" and \"Intimate Games.\"",

            "Nurse stereotypes\nA stereotype is a generalized idea or image about a particular person or thing that is often oversimplified and offensive. Stereotypes are victim of prejudice when negative portrayals of a group are untrue of individual members. Nursing has been stereotyped throughout the history of the profession. A common misconception is that all nurses are female; this has led to the stereotype of male nurses as effeminate. These generalized ideas of the nursing profession have formed a skewed image of nurses in the media. The image of a nurse projected by the media is typically of a young white single female being over-sexualized as well as diminished intellectually; this idea is then portrayed in get-well cards, television shows and novels. The over-sexualized nurse is commonly referred to as a naughty nurse and is shown as a sex symbol or nymphomaniac. Along with these common stereotypes, studies have identified several other popular images used in media such as handmaiden, angel, torturer, homosexual male, alcoholic, buffoon and woman in white. Common stereotypes of nursing and portrayal of these misconceptions have fueled a discussion on the effects they have on the profession, harmful or good.",

Currie was the lead vocalist of the Runaways, a rock band from Los Angeles, in the mid-to-late 1970s. After the Runaways, she became a solo artist. Then she teamed up with her identical twin sister, Marie Currie, and released an album with her. They released a duet \"Since You Been Gone\" which charted number 95 on US charts.

            "Messin' with the Boys\nMessin' with the Boys is the second post-Runaways album by Cherie Currie, released in 1980 For this album Currie worked with her identical twin sister, Marie Currie. Their band was called \"Cherie and Marie Currie\". Marie was a guest vocalist on Cherie's first album, so Marie went on tour with Cherie to support her first album, \"Beauty's Only Skin Deep\". When Marie would join Cherie on stage to sing the encores the audience would go wild. So Cherie ran with the idea of two blonds are better than one. The idea paid off because \"Messin' with the Boys\" received more radio play than \"Beauty's Only Skin Deep\", and their song \"Since You Been Gone\" made it to 95 on US charts. The single \"This Time\" and the album Messin' with the Boys made the top 200 on U.S. charts. This makes Messin' with the Boys Cherie Currie's most successful album. \"I Just Love the Feeling\" originally surfaced on the 1974 album, \"S.S. Fools\" by the group of the same name.
