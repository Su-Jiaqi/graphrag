                "Lophodermium\nLophodermium is a genus of fungi within the family Rhytismataceae. The genus contains 145 species and has a global distribution. Species of this genus are usually observed producing zone lines, conidiomata and ascomata on dead fallen leaves, but at least some are known to colonize living leaves. In many cases they then live inside the colonized leaf as a symptomless endobiont, where they are regarded as detritivores utilising dead plant matter. In a few cases they may kill all or part of the leaf prematurely, and there is a substantial literature dealing with those species as plant pathogens. The genus infects many different plant families but with a notable concentration in the family Pinaceae; many \"Lophodermium\" species are restricted to a single host genus (or even species), but some, particularly those infecting grasses, may infect several genera. Some are economically important plant pathogens, such as those that cause needlecast disease in European Black Pine, Scots Pine and Red Pine in forestry and christmas tree plantations. In these species, notably \"L. pinastri\" and \"L. seditiosum\", the fungal spores disperse and infect the pine needles in late summer, which turn brown by the following spring and then fall off.",

The genus is distributed from northern China and Japan, to India in the west, and Australia in the south, with most species being located wholly or partly in the tropics. The genus is also sometimes considered to include the genus \"Bowdleria\", which holds the fernbirds of New Zealand. The most widespread species, the tawny grassbird, ranges from the Philippines to southern New South Wales, whereas the Fly River grassbird is restricted to swampland in the southern part of New Guinea. The natural habitat of the typical grassbirds is, as the name suggests, wet grasslands, swamps and other marshlands. Some species exist away from water in tall grasslands, heathlands, and forest clearings. Some species have adapted to the margins of rice fields and gardens.",

The other perennial, \"Z. diploperennis,\" is the sister taxon of \"Z. perennis\". Those two species also form a clade with \"Z. luxurians\". Together, the three species make up the \"Luxuriantes\" section in the genus \"Zea\". \"Z. perennis\" is the sole tetraploid in the genus and fertile hybrids with diploid \"Zea\" species are rare. Ribosomal ITS evidence suggested introgression between \"Z. perennis\" and \"Z. mays\" that must have come from either crossing the ploidy barrier or been from the diploid ancestral pool. \"Z. perennis\" is generally considered to be an autotetraploid from some ancestral population of \"Z. diploperennis\".",
                "Asiatosuchus\nAsiatosuchus is an extinct genus of crocodyloid crocodilians that lived in Eurasia during the Paleogene.

These species have a generalized crocodilian morphology typified by flat, triangular skulls. The feature that traditionally united these species under the genus \"Asiatosuchus\" is a broad connection or symphysis between the two halves of the lower jaw.

                "Megalurus\nMegalurus is a genus of passerine bird in the family Locustellidae. The genus was once placed in the Old World warbler \"wastebin\" family Sylviidae. The genus contains six species also known as the typical grassbirds. The genus is distributed from northern China and Japan, to India in the west, and Australia in the south, with most species being located wholly or partly in the tropics. The genus is also sometimes considered to include the genus \"Bowdleria\", which holds the fernbirds of New Zealand. The most widespread species, the tawny grassbird, ranges from the Philippines to southern New South Wales, whereas the Fly River grassbird is restricted to swampland in the southern part of New Guinea. The natural habitat of the typical grassbirds is, as the name suggests, wet grasslands, swamps and other marshlands. Some species exist away from water in tall grasslands, heathlands, and forest clearings. Some species have adapted to the margins of rice fields and gardens.",
                "Zea perennis\nZea perennis, the perennial teosinte, is a true grass species in the genus \"Zea\" and a teosinte. It is one of the two perennial species in the genus \"Zea\". The other perennial, \"Z. diploperennis,\" is the sister taxon of \"Z. perennis\". Those two species also form a clade with \"Z. luxurians\". Together, the three species make up the \"Luxuriantes\" section in the genus \"Zea\". \"Z. perennis\" is the sole tetraploid in the genus and fertile hybrids with diploid \"Zea\" species are rare. Ribosomal ITS evidence suggested introgression between \"Z. perennis\" and \"Z. mays\" that must have come from either crossing the ploidy barrier or been from the diploid ancestral pool. \"Z. perennis\" is generally considered to be an autotetraploid from some ancestral population of \"Z. diploperennis\".",
                "Asiatosuchus\nAsiatosuchus is an extinct genus of crocodyloid crocodilians that lived in Eurasia during the Paleogene. Many Paleogene crocodilians from Europe and Asia have been attributed to \"Asiatosuchus\" since the genus was named in 1940. These species have a generalized crocodilian morphology typified by flat, triangular skulls. The feature that traditionally united these species under the genus \"Asiatosuchus\" is a broad connection or symphysis between the two halves of the lower jaw. Recent studies of the evolutionary relationships of early crocodilians along with closer examinations of the morphology of fossil specimens suggest that only the first named species of \"Asiatosuchus\", \"A. grangeri\" from the Eocene of Mongolia, belongs in the genus. Most species are now regarded as \"nomina dubia\" or \"dubious names\", meaning that their type specimens lack the unique anatomical features necessary to justify their classification as distinct species. Other species such as \"\"A.\" germanicus\" and \"\"A.\" depressifrons\" are still considered valid species, but they do not form an evolutionary grouping with \"A. grangeri\" that would warrant them being placed together in the genus \"Asiatosuchus\".",
