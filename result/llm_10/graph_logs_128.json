                "Manon Lescaut (Puccini)\nManon Lescaut is an opera in four acts by Giacomo Puccini, composed between 1890 and 1893. The story is based on the 1731 novel \"L'histoire du chevalier des Grieux et de Manon Lescaut\" by the Abb\u00e9 Pr\u00e9vost and should not be confused with \"Manon\", an 1884 opera by Jules Massenet based on the same novel.",
                "Boulevard Solitude\nBoulevard Solitude is a \"Lyrisches Drama \" (lyric drama) or opera in one act by Hans Werner Henze to a German libretto by Grete Weil after the play by Walter Jockisch, in its turn a modern retelling of Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9vost's \"Manon Lescaut\". The piece is a reworking of the Manon Lescaut story, already adapted operatically by Auber, Massenet and Puccini, and here relocated to Paris after the Second World War where, as is noted in Grove, the focus of the story moves away from Manon and towards Armand des Grieux. It became Henze\u2019s first fully-fledged opera. The work stands out for its strong jazz influences, from a composer who had hitherto been associated with twelve tone technique.",

A \"dramma giocoso\" characteristically used a grand \"buffo\" (comic or farce) scene as a dramatic climax at the end of an act. Goldoni's texts always consisted of two long acts with extended finales, followed by a short third act. Composers Baldassare Galuppi, Niccol\u00f2 Piccinni, and Joseph Haydn set Goldoni's texts to music.",
