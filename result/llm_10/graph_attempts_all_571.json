            "The Time of Our Time\nThe Time of Our Time is an anthology of Norman Mailer\u2019s various literary works, published by Modern Library in 1998. The work was designed to commemorate both the fiftieth anniversary of \"The Naked and the Dead\" (1948), and Mailer\u2019s seventy-fifth birthday. Norman Mailer edited the anthology himself, choosing to organize the content not by the chronology in which the pieces are written, but the chronology of the events that the works describe; some of the excerpts are written in the midst of the action, while others may come upon forty years of reflection. Selected texts that deal with the ancient world, however, appear out of sequence at the end of the volume. (Mailer\u2019s explanation: \u201cNobody is perfect.\u201d) Excerpts from Mailer\u2019s most notable works, including \"The Naked and the Dead\", \"Advertisements for Myself\" (1959), \"Superman Comes to the Supermarket\" (1960), \"The Armies of the Night\" (1968), \"Miami and the Siege of Chicago\" (1968), \"Of a Fire on the Moon\" (1970), and \"The Executioner's Song\" (1979), as well as several works in their entirety, including \"The White Negro: Superficial Reflections on the Hipster\" (1957), \"The Time of Her Time\" (1959), and various transcribed and annotated interviews with the likes of William F.

            "Nemegtomaia\nNemegtomaia is a genus of oviraptorid dinosaur from what is now Mongolia that lived in the Late Cretaceous Period, about 70million years ago. The first specimen was found in 1996, and became the basis of the new genus and species N. barsboldi in 2004. The original genus name was \"Nemegtia\", but this was changed to \"Nemegtomaia\" in 2005, as the former name was preoccupied. The first part of the generic name refers to the Nemegt Basin, where the animal was found, and the second part means \"good mother\", in reference to the fact that oviraptorids are known to have brooded their eggs. The specific name honours the palaeontologist Rinchen Barsbold. Two more specimens were found in 2007, one of which was found on top of a nest with eggs, but the dinosaur had received its genus name before it was found associated with eggs.",

It began in 1954 as \"Archie's Christmas Stocking\", and continued with this title for six issues. Although the \"Christmas Stocking\" title appeared again in later issues, the book began to feature a number of different titles, each with the cover heading \"Archie Giant Series\". Titles included \"World of Archie\", \"World of Jughead\", \"Katy Keene\", \"Betty and Veronica Summer Spectacular\", \"Sabrina's Christmas Magic\" and many others. One additional interesting item about this title is that it twice skipped in its numbering. Numbering continued up to #35, then skipped to #136. Again after reaching #251, the title skipped to #452.
