Later these loans would give the U.S. political influence and access to natural resources for U.S. companies. He refers to this as an \"economic hit man.\" Although he states that throughout his career he has always worked for private companies, and suggests a system of corporatocracy and greed, rather than a single conspiracy, he claims the involvement of the National Security Agency (NSA), with whom he had interviewed for a job before joining Main.

It starts by gathering basic biographical data about Fred Gehrke, then separately identifies who the 23rd pick was in the 2010 MLB Draft. With this foundational information, further steps investigate Gehrke's connections that could be relevant, such as family, business, or professional associations, while also retrieving detailed information about the draft pick. The final reasoning step synthesizes these data points to determine if there is a direct or indirect connection between the two individuals."
