            "Memory of Mankind\nSeveral motivations underlie the project. The primary ambition of MOM is to preserve an image of our era, created by numerous participants all over the planet. MOM will also contain information which our society is obliged to forward to the future: e.g. description of nuclear waste repositories. MOM collaborates with the NEA and SKB. Although the most obvious ambition and often described in the media is the concern about preserving our knowledge, this is not the primary goal of MOM. Serving as a time capsule MOM is both: in a time frame of millennia it is the story about us, and in a time frame of decades it is a backup. In times where global warming, nuclear danger and biological warfare threaten the existence of civilization, saving the core knowledge and culture acquired over centuries is a backup measure. In case of a collapse, the MOM project could help survivors to rebuild civilization. Linked to this, an another reason is of political order: facing the lack of reactivity of authorities concerning global warming, the MOM project is a reminder of what can happen. Roman and Greek civilizations whose histories have been reconstructed by the small percentage of texts and artifacts which survived until our days are examples that have inspired the MOM project. Finally, it's a critic of our digital civilization : according to Kunze, maybe nothing of the 21st century will last in the future, since most of our interactions are now virtual. The \"accuracy versus bullshit\" is one of the main themes of the MOM project, worried about loss of information, the project can only aim to save a fragment of the information produced until today, but this fragment has to be representative.",

NaGISA is the first project of the larger CoML effort (Census of Marine Life) to have global participation in actual field work. The actual procedures of this project involve inexpensive collection equipment (for easy universal participation). This equipment is used to photograph sampling sites, to actually take samples from the sites, and to process these samples. At each site throughout the world, samples are taken from the intertidal zone out to a depth of 10 meters (and optionally out to 20 meters depth). These samples are then processed (the organisms are isolated) and then analyzed and catalogued. The information (regarding the kind and number of organisms analyzed) is sent to the global headquarters of NaGISA- the University of Kyoto in Japan. All of this information is then collated on the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS website). The end goal of the larger CoML effort is to find what \"was\", what \"is\", and what \"will be\" in the world's oceans. For NaGISA the goal is to find this in the world's in-shore areas.",

            "Revenge tragedy\nRevenge tragedy (less commonly referred to as revenge drama, revenge play, or tragedy of blood) defines a genre of plays made popular in early modern England. Ashley H. Thorndike formally established this genre in his seminal 1902 article \"The Relations of Hamlet to Contemporary Revenge Plays,\" which characterizes revenge tragedy \"as a tragedy whose leading motive is revenge and whose main action deals with the progress of this revenge, leading to the death of the murderers and often the death of the avenger himself.\" Thomas Kyd's \"The Spanish Tragedy\" (c.1580s) is often considered the inaugural revenge tragedy on the early modern stage. However, more recent research extends early modern revenge tragedy to the 1560s with poet and classicist Jasper Heywood's translations of Seneca at Oxford University, including \"Troas\" (1559), \"Thyestes\" (1560), and \"Hercules Furens\" (1561). Additionally, Thomases Norton and Sackville's play \"Gorbuduc\" (1561) is considered an early revenge tragedy (almost twenty years prior to \"The Spanish Tragedy\"). Other well-known revenge tragedies include William Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\" (c.1599-1602) and \"Titus Andronicus\" (c.1588-1593) and Thomas Middleton's \"The Revenger's Tragedy\" (c.1606)."

While Shakespeare plays do not typically have inductions, they are sometimes depicted as part of the device of the play within the play. Examples include the dumb show in \"Hamlet\" and the address to the audience by Puck in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\". Another example, in \"The Spanish Tragedy\" by Thomas Kyd, is the introduction to that play by the ghost of Andrea who preps the audience by laying out the story to come. Likewise, Shakespeare's \"The Taming of the Shrew\" opens with induction scenes which involve characters watching the play proper.",

            "The Time of Our Time\nThe Time of Our Time is an anthology of Norman Mailer\u2019s various literary works, published by Modern Library in 1998. The work was designed to commemorate both the fiftieth anniversary of \"The Naked and the Dead\" (1948), and Mailer\u2019s seventy-fifth birthday. Norman Mailer edited the anthology himself, choosing to organize the content not by the chronology in which the pieces are written, but the chronology of the events that the works describe; some of the excerpts are written in the midst of the action, while others may come upon forty years of reflection. Selected texts that deal with the ancient world, however, appear out of sequence at the end of the volume. (Mailer\u2019s explanation: \u201cNobody is perfect.\u201d) Excerpts from Mailer\u2019s most notable works, including \"The Naked and the Dead\", \"Advertisements for Myself\" (1959), \"Superman Comes to the Supermarket\" (1960), \"The Armies of the Night\" (1968), \"Miami and the Siege of Chicago\" (1968), \"Of a Fire on the Moon\" (1970), and \"The Executioner's Song\" (1979), as well as several works in their entirety, including \"The White Negro: Superficial Reflections on the Hipster\" (1957), \"The Time of Her Time\" (1959), and various transcribed and annotated interviews with the likes of William F.
