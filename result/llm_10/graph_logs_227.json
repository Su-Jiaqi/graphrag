The four-piece band consisted of Soundgarden lead singer/rhythm guitarist Chris Cornell and Rage Against the Machine members Tom Morello (lead guitar), Tim Commerford (bass/backing vocals), and Brad Wilk (drums).

The first two nodes (1 and 2) are responsible for retrieving and reasoning about the formation years of the two bands, Audioslave and Bodyjar. Each band is treated in a separate retrieval step to gather specific information. Once the formation years are gathered, the third node (3) performs reasoning to compare these years and determines which band was formed earlier. This final reasoning step is dependent on the information retrieved in the first two steps."
