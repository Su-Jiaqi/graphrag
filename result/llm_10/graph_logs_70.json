Virgil, Morgan, and Doc Holliday were wounded, but Wyatt Earp was unharmed.

I immediately said I had when in point of fact I did not know what he meant, and there was a young man in the office with Sir David Cunnynghame called Lew Watt, and he said Lew Watt will do the technical side and we want you to subtitle an Italian picture in to English. I said certainly . I came out of his office and Lew Watt said to me you don't know what they're talking about do you, I said you're quite right, he said well I'll show you. And I started subtitling pictures with Lew Watt, I used to do the literary side, and he used to do the technical side, the spotting, and lengths, and we together did subtitles for 40 or 50 pictures. The funny thing was we subtitled pictures in Chinese, in Indian and for the Chinese picture I had to have a Chinese waiter with me to tell me where the subtitles [...] I had the Italian dialogue and I had the picture, they gave me a film and we did the spotting together with Lew Watt and the measurements and I used to type the script.

Typically, an induction precedes the main text of a play. Inductions are a common feature of plays written and performed in the Renaissance period, including those of Shakespeare. While Shakespeare plays do not typically have inductions, they are sometimes depicted as part of the device of the play within the play. Examples include the dumb show in \"Hamlet\" and the address to the audience by Puck in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\". Another example, in \"The Spanish Tragedy\" by Thomas Kyd, is the introduction to that play by the ghost of Andrea who preps the audience by laying out the story to come. Likewise, Shakespeare's \"The Taming of the Shrew\" opens with induction scenes which involve characters watching the play proper."

                "Thomas Fitch, an American lawyer and politician, had a professional relationship with John Henry \"Doc\" Holliday, an American gambler and gunfighter. Fitch successfully defended Holliday, along with Wyatt Earp and others, when they were accused of murdering Billy Clanton and the McLaury brothers during the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral in 1881. This legal defense demonstrates their professional association in the context of legal matters.",
                "The gunfight at the O.K. Corral occurred on October 26, 1881, in Tombstone, Arizona Territory. It was a 30-second shootout between lawmen and members of a group of outlaws called the Cowboys. The shootout resulted in the deaths of Billy Clanton, and Tom and Frank McLaury, and the wounding of Virgil, Morgan, and Doc Holliday. Wyatt Earp was unharmed. The gunfight has become one of the most famous shootouts in the history of the American Wild West. It was the result of a long-standing feud between the two groups, with the Earp brothers being the target of repeated death threats made by the Cowboys. The aftermath of the gunfight led to murder charges being filed against the Earps and Doc Holliday by Ike Clanton, who was present at the gunfight but claimed to be unarmed and fled. The O.K. Corral and the surrounding area have been designated as a National Historic Landmark due to their association with this historic event.",
                "Thomas Fitch defended John Henry Holliday, along with Wyatt Earp and others, when they were accused of murdering Billy Clanton and the McLaury brothers during the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral in 1881. This confirms that the event where Thomas Fitch defended John Henry Holliday is directly related to the aftermath of the gunfight at the O.K. Corral.",
                "The gunfight at the O.K. Corral took place in 1881. Therefore, the legal charges and the defense of John Henry Holliday by Thomas Fitch would have been relevant in 1881."
