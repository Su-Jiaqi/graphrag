Dictionaries from the early 20th century attributed slightly more than half of the Bengali vocabulary to native words (i.e., naturally modified Sanskrit words, corrupted forms of Sanskrit words, and loanwords from non-Indo-European languages), about 30 percent to unmodified Sanskrit words, and the remainder to foreign words. Dominant in the last group was Persian, which was also the source of some grammatical forms. More recent studies suggest that the use of native and foreign words has been increasing, mainly because of the preference of Bengali speakers for the colloquial style.

Over the course of their nearly twenty-year career, the group toured heavily and released six studio albums, the majority on independent label Epitaph Records. The band's sound, at times described as pop punk or emo, made notable use of the Moog synthesizer.",
                "The Process (Skinny Puppy album)\nThe Process is the eighth studio album by industrial band Skinny Puppy. Many factors complicated the recording of \"The Process\". The album's producer changed multiple times, from Roli Mosimann to Martin Atkins to Dave Ogilvie. According to cEvin Key, their label, American Recordings, had pressured the band into adopting a more commercial sound or more Industrial metal sound similar to Nine Inch Nails. Following tensions between band members, Nivek Ogre left the band on June 12, 1995. American Recordings decided to drop Skinny Puppy after the release of \"The Process\". The band's keyboardist, Dwayne Goettel, died of a heroin overdose shortly thereafter on August 23, 1995. Following Dwayne's death, cEvin and Dave completed mixing of \"The Process\".",
                "Ethnic religion\nIn religious studies, ethnic religion (or indigenous religion) is the expression of religion associated with a particular ethnic group. Ethnic religions are often distinguished from religions which claim to not be limited in ethnic or national scope, such as Christianity or Islam. Ethnic religions do not have to be excluded to independent religions. Some localized denominations of global religions are practiced solely by certain ethnic groups, with ethnic groups like the Assyrians following a unique denominational structure of Christianity known as the Assyrian Church of the East."

                "The Oku people, also known as Oku Mohammedans, are descendants of liberated Africans of Yoruba descent from Southwest Nigeria who settled in Sierra Leone in the mid-19th century. They are virtually all Muslims and are known for their conservative Muslim population. The Oku people are traditionally considered as a distinctive ethnic group, although the Sierra Leone government officially considers them as members of the Creole ethnic group.\n\nThe language traditionally spoken by the Oku people is not explicitly mentioned in the provided information. However, given their Yoruba descent, it is likely that they may have retained elements of the Yoruba language in their speech, especially considering that they formed a distinctive ethnic group in Sierra Leone. It is also possible that they may have developed a unique creole language influenced by their Yoruba heritage and the languages of other ethnic groups in Sierra Leone.\n\nFurther research into the specific language spoken by the Oku people, including any unique linguistic features or influences, would provide a more comprehensive understanding of their traditional language."
