He works primarily on hip hop music, and has produced or co-produced for artists Snoop Dogg and Shaquille O'Neal. Wells is also the son of Motown singer Mary Wells and musician/songwriter, Cecil Womack. Being the son of Motown legend Mary Wells may have helped jumpstart Meech Wells' career, but the West Coast rap producer quickly proved his talent and eventually aligned himself with Snoop Dogg, another relationship that definitely didn't hurt his career. Before being Snoop's producer of choice during the late 1990s and early 2000s, Wells began his career as part of a funk band called Trey Lewd that also featured Tracey Lewis, George Clinton's son; this provided him with the opportunity to work with Clinton himself. By 1993, Wells found himself working alongside producer/rapper Def Jef; the two's production on Shaquille O'Neil's \"I Got Skillz\" (a surprise hit single) won them instant credentials. Throughout the mid-'90s, he continued to hone his craft, working on a number of remix projects before eventually being introduced to Snoop through a friend. Before long, the two were working together as a potent duo, beginning with \"Still a G Thang,\" one of the better songs on Snoop's Da Game Is to Be Sold, Not to Be Told. Wells produced a few No Limit songs featuring Snoop\u2014Tru's \"It's a Beautiful Thang,\" Silkk the Shocker's \"Get It Up\"\u2014before playing a major role in bringing a West Coast sound to Snoop's Top Dogg album in 1999: \"In Love With a Thug,\" \"Better Days,\" \"Gangsta Ride,\" among others.
