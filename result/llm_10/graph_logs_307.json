So named for the Japanese word \"nagisa\" (\"where the land meets the sea\"), it is an Apronym. NaGISA is the first project of the larger CoML effort (Census of Marine Life) to have global participation in actual field work. The actual procedures of this project involve inexpensive collection equipment (for easy universal participation). This equipment is used to photograph sampling sites, to actually take samples from the sites, and to process these samples. At each site throughout the world, samples are taken from the intertidal zone out to a depth of 10 meters (and optionally out to 20 meters depth). These samples are then processed (the organisms are isolated) and then analyzed and catalogued. The information (regarding the kind and number of organisms analyzed) is sent to the global headquarters of NaGISA- the University of Kyoto in Japan. All of this information is then collated on the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS website). The end goal of the larger CoML effort is to find what \"was\", what \"is\", and what \"will be\" in the world's oceans. For NaGISA the goal is to find this in the world's in-shore areas.",

                "Postpipe\nIn archaeology, a postpipe (or post pipe) is the remains of an upright timber placed in a posthole. Given the right conditions, timbers may survive over long periods of time and a recovered postpipe can simply be of solid wood. Under less preservative conditions however, only a dark circular stain of organic material may be left in the fill of the posthole observable in plan and section. This differs in consistency from the less organic backfill of the posthole and can be identified simply through this change in make-up. The size and depth and of the postpipe can provide information as to any reuse of the posthole especially if several different postpipes can be identified. They can also indicate the species of wood used and help suggest the nature of the structure that the timber once supported. The term was first used by Maud Cunnington when she excavated the site of Woodhenge in the English county of Wiltshire during the 1920s and found numerous examples of decomposed timber posts.",
                "Sharon Gannon\nSharon Gannon (born July 4, 1951 in Washington, D.C.) is a yoga teacher, animal rights advocate, musician, author, dancer/choreographer and painter. Along with David Life, she is the co-founder of the Jivamukti Yoga Method which contributed to the exponential rise in popularity of yoga in the west during the late 20th century. The Jivamukti Yoga Method distinguishes itself as a path to enlightenment by promoting compassion for all beings, challenging the modern belief that enslaving and exploiting animals and the natural world is our right as the dominant species. The Jivamukti Yoga Method teaches its students that they must be willing to promote the happiness of all beings without exception if they wish to realize their fullest capacity for joy. Jivamukti students are encouraged to adopt a diet that eliminates all animal products (vegan) as this is the diet that causes the least amount of harm to the earth and other beings, humans included. Core to the teachings of Jivamukti Yoga is the concept of shunyata or (emptiness) which is found in the ancient yogic scriptures. This idea can be simply stated as: everything you see and experience in the world comes from your perception of it. If you want to change someone or to change the world, you start by changing yourself by changing your views. When you begin to embrace this concept and put it into practice then you cannot find solace in complaining or blaming others. You are freed from seeing yourself as a victim of others or of circumstances. According to Gannon: \"How you treat others will determine how others treat you. How others treat you will determine how you see yourself. How you see yourself will determine who you are.\"",

                "Strid (band)\nStrid is a Norwegian black metal band that was originally known as \"Malfeitor\" from 1991 to 1992. After releasing two demos - \"Malfeitor\" (in 1991) and \"Pandemonium\" (in 1992), they changed their name to \"Battle\" and there were some line up changes at the time. In the year of 1992 the band released the \"End of Life\" demo. The demo contains only one song which is around 11 minutes. The line up at the time of recording the demo was: Storm - on bass and vocals, Lars Fredrik Bergstr\u00f8m - on guitars and Jardar - on drums. The guitars were written by Lars Fredrik Bergstr\u00f8m (1974 - 2014). In 1993 the band changed the name to \"Strid\" which means \"Battle\" in Norwegian. That same year, Strid re-released their \"End of Life\" demo under their new name, through the German label \"Malicious Records\". After releasing the \"End of life\" demo, Lars Fredrik Bergstr\u00f8m left the band and was replaced by Ravn Harjar. Through the years between 1993 and 1995, the band writes and records the self-titled EP which was released through Malicious Records and contains only two songs - \"Det hviskes blant sorte vinder\" which means \"It Is Whispered Amid the Black Winds\" in Norwegian and \"Nattevandring\" which means \"Nightwandering\" in Norwegian. The music style and sound of this demo is more ambient/atmospheric black metal oriented. Mainly because of this release, the band is commonly recognised as the creators of depressive black metal along with some other bands from the second wave of black metal music. At this time the band line up contains: Ravn Harjar - on guitars, Storm - on bass and vocals and Jardar - on drums. After the releasing of the self-titled EP, there was no any official releases by the band. There are also bootleg releases that came out through the years like the CD from 2005 by Ars Mysteriorum and LP, each featuring both \"End of Life\" and the self - titled EP tracks. In the year of 2001 the original former member of \"Malfeitor/Battle/Strid\", bass player and vocalist - Storm committed suicide. In the year of 2007, the Greek label Kyrck Productions & Armour re-released all the previous material released by the band from the past which contains all \"Malfeitor/Battle/Strid\" material. Somewhere between 2009 and 2010 there was a reunion of the band with old members including Vicotnik (D\u00f8dheimsgard, ex-Aphrodisiac, ex-Ved Buens Ende, ex-Manes, ex-Code, ex-Naer Mataron, ex-Endwarfment). Another member that was part of the reunion was Lars Fredrik Bergstr\u00f8m - the main composer of the \"End of Life\" track. In 2014 Lars Fredrik Bergstr\u00f8m died. At this time the band line up contains Ravn Harjar - on guitars and vocals, Vicotnik - on bass and Sigmund (ex-Inflabitan, ex-D\u00f8dheimsgard) - on guitars. In January 2015, Ravn Harjar wrote a statement on the official Strid Facebook page that in the autumn of the year 2015 the band will start recording their first full-length album which will be titled \"Endetid\".

After releasing two demos - \"Malfeitor\" (in 1991) and \"Pandemonium\" (in 1992), they changed their name to \"Battle\" and there were some line up changes at the time. In the year of 1992 the band released the \"End of Life\" demo. The demo contains only one song which is around 11 minutes. The line up at the time of recording the demo was: Storm - on bass and vocals, Lars Fredrik Bergstr\u00f8m - on guitars and Jardar - on drums. The guitars were written by Lars Fredrik Bergstr\u00f8m (1974 - 2014). In 1993 the band changed the name to \"Strid\" which means \"Battle\" in Norwegian. That same year, Strid re-released their \"End of Life\" demo under their new name, through the German label \"Malicious Records\". After releasing the \"End of life\" demo, Lars Fredrik Bergstr\u00f8m left the band and was replaced by Ravn Harjar. Through the years between 1993 and 1995, the band writes and records the self-titled EP which was released through Malicious Records and contains only two songs - \"Det hviskes blant sorte vinder\" which means \"It Is Whispered Amid the Black Winds\" in Norwegian and \"Nattevandring\" which means \"Nightwandering\" in Norwegian. The music style and sound of this demo is more ambient/atmospheric black metal oriented. Mainly because of this release, the band is commonly recognised as the creators of depressive black metal along with some other bands from the second wave of black metal music. At this time the band line up contains: Ravn Harjar - on guitars, Storm - on bass and vocals and Jardar - on drums. After the releasing of the self-titled EP, there was no any official releases by the band. There are also bootleg releases that came out through the years like the CD from 2005 by Ars Mysteriorum and LP, each featuring both \"End of Life\" and the self - titled EP tracks. In the year of 2001 the original former member of \"Malfeitor/Battle/Strid\", bass player and vocalist - Storm committed suicide. In the year of 2007, the Greek label Kyrck Productions & Armour re-released all the previous material released by the band from the past which contains all \"Malfeitor/Battle/Strid\" material.
