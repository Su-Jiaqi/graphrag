The American Football Conference (AFC) champion New England Patriots, after trailing by as many as 25 points (28-3) during the third quarter, defeated the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Atlanta Falcons, 34\u201328 in overtime. The Patriots' 25-point comeback is the largest comeback in Super Bowl history, and Super Bowl LI was the first to be decided in overtime.",

He was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in the fifth round of the 2011 NFL Draft. With the Patriots, he won Super Bowl LI over the Atlanta Falcons. He played college football at the University of Pittsburgh. Lewis has also played for the Cleveland Browns and Indianapolis Colts. His Patriots teammate, receiver Julian Edelman, has nicknamed Lewis both \"Jitterbug\" and \"Little Dirty\". Lewis had not played for two seasons before signing with the Patriots in 2015, and was a significant contributor to the New England offense before a season-ending knee injury in Week 9 put him out of the line-up. Two reconstructive surgeries on his damaged knee kept him sidelined until part way through the 2016 season, his return on November 12, 2016 made a direct impact; his career-defining performance coming in the Patriots over the Houston Texans, where Lewis had 188 all-purpose yards and became the first player in NFL history to score a touchdown on a rush, a reception, and a kick return during the same playoff game. Notably, as of the end of the 2016-2017 season, Lewis has never played in a game which the Patriots have subsequently lost.",

The Cowboys defeated the Bills by the score of 30\u201313, winning their fourth Super Bowl in team history, tying the Pittsburgh Steelers and the San Francisco 49ers for most Super Bowl wins. The game was played on January 30, 1994, at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta, Georgia. Since the 1993 regular season was conducted over 18 weeks (two byes per team), the traditional bye week between the conference championship games and the Super Bowl was removed. This was only the third Super Bowl with only one week after that conference title games; the others were Super Bowl IV and Super Bowl XVII.",
                "2007 New York Giants season\nThe 2007 New York Giants season was the 83rd season for the New York Giants in the National Football League. The Giants finished the regular season 10\u20136 and in second place in the NFC East, improving upon their 8\u20138 record in 2006 in which they finished third in their division. They qualified for the playoffs as a wild-card team as the #5 seed, and beat the #4 seed Tampa Bay Buccaneers (9\u20137), the top-seeded Dallas Cowboys (13\u20133), and the #2 seed Green Bay Packers (13\u20133) to become the National Football Conference representative in Super Bowl XLII. There, they defeated the heavily favored and previously undefeated 18\u20130 New England Patriots and spoiled their perfect season. The 2007 New York Giants became the 9th wild card team in NFL history to reach the Super Bowl and the 5th wild card team to win the Super Bowl, and the very first NFC wild card to accomplish the feat. They were the third team in history to win three road playoff games en route to a Super Bowl and set a league record for most consecutive road wins in a single season (11), though the Super Bowl is played on a neutral field rather than an opponent's stadium. It was the 7th league championship season for the New York Giants and their first since they won Super Bowl XXV in 1991.",
                "Super Bowl XXVII\nSuper Bowl XXVII was an American football game between the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Buffalo Bills and the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Dallas Cowboys to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 1992 season. The Cowboys crushed the Bills by the score of 52\u201317, winning their third Super Bowl in team history, and their first one in fifteen years. This game is tied with Super Bowl XXXVII as the second highest scoring Super Bowl ever with 69 combined points. The Bills became the first team to lose three consecutive Super Bowls, and just the second team to play in three straight (the Miami Dolphins played in Super Bowls VI\u2013VIII, winning VII and VIII). The game was played on January 31, 1993 at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, the seventh and most recent Super Bowl (until 2022 when Los Angeles hosts again) that the Greater Los Angeles Area has hosted.",

The Raiders are looking to win their first AFC West title since 2002 and the Super Bowl for the first time since 1983, when the club was still in Los Angeles. The Raiders began the season on September 10 at the Tennessee Titans and will finish the season December 31 at the Los Angeles Chargers. The Raiders, as they did in 2016, will play one home game in Mexico City, this time against the New England Patriots.",
                "1982 Miami Dolphins season\nThe 1982 Miami Dolphins season was the team's seventeenth in the National Football League. The team was coming off an unexpected 11-4-1 1981 season and a devastating loss to the San Diego Chargers in the Divisional Round the previous season in a game dubbed the Epic in Miami. The Dolphins had clinched the 2 seed and were picked by many to reach the Super Bowl during the 1981 season. Because of the high number of picks to reach the Super Bowl the previous season, many more fans picked them to win it during the 1982 season. The Dolphins looked to improve on their 11-4-1 record from 1981. However, a players strike cancelled 7 of the team's 16 games. Because of this, the NFL schedule was shrunk to 9 games. The Dolphins started out fresh, winning their first 2 games prior to the strike. When season play resumed 2 months later, the Dolphins defeated the Buffalo Bills 9-7 in Buffalo to clinch a 3-0 start. After a loss to Tampa Bay, they defeated the Minnesota Vikings 22-14. The next week, they lost a brisk game against the Patriots 3-0 in a game called the Snowplow Game. The Dolphins would then win 3 straight games to end the season 7-2, tied for 2nd in the AFC with the Cincinnati Bengals. The Dolphins won 2nd place over them by virtue of a series of tiebreakers. In the playoffs, they defeated the Patriots in a rematch by the score of 28-13. They then defeated the Chargers in a rematch of the 1981 Divisional Playoffs by a score of 34-13. In the AFC Championship game, they shutout the Jets, 14-0 to reach the Super Bowl for the first time since 1973. In Super Bowl XVII, they lost to the Redskins 27-17 in a rematch of Super Bowl VII which concluded Miami's perfect 1972 season.",

The Raiders defeated the Redskins by the score of 38\u20139. The Raiders, coached by Tom Flores,' 38 points and their 29-point margin of victory broke Super Bowl records; it still remains the most points scored by an AFC team in a Super Bowl. The game was played on January 22, 1984, at Tampa Stadium in Tampa, Florida, the first time the Super Bowl was held in that city. This would be the AFC's last Super Bowl win until Super Bowl XXXII, won by the Denver Broncos.",

The Seahawks defeated the Broncos 43\u20138, the largest margin of victory for an underdog and tied for the third largest point differential overall (35) in Super Bowl history with Super Bowl XXVII (1993). It was the first time the winning team scored over 40 points, while holding their opponent to under 10. This became the first Super Bowl victory for the Seahawks and the fifth Super Bowl loss for the Broncos, the most of any team. The game was played on February 2, 2014, at MetLife Stadium at the Meadowlands Sports Complex in East Rutherford, New Jersey, the first Super Bowl played outdoors in a cold-weather city and the first Super Bowl to be played on a February 2.",
                "1988 Chicago Bears season\nThe 1988 Chicago Bears season was their 69th regular season and 19th postseason completed in the National Football League. The Bears looked to improve on an 11\u20134 finish that won them the NFC Central Division but where they were eliminated for the second consecutive year by the Washington Redskins. The Bears won 12 games and lost 4, tying for the best record in the league with the Buffalo Bills and the AFC Champion Cincinnati Bengals, and earned home field advantage in the NFC. However, the Bears failed to advance to the Super Bowl as one of the top two seeds for a third straight season, falling to the eventual Super Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers in the NFC Championship Game at Soldier Field. This was the second time that the 49ers and Bears had met for a trip to the Super Bowl during the decade, with the 49ers defeating the Bears on their way to Super Bowl XIX."

The team was coming off an unexpected 11-4-1 1981 season and a devastating loss to the San Diego Chargers in the Divisional Round the previous season in a game dubbed the Epic in Miami. The Dolphins had clinched the 2 seed and were picked by many to reach the Super Bowl during the 1981 season. Because of the high number of picks to reach the Super Bowl the previous season, many more fans picked them to win it during the 1982 season. The Dolphins looked to improve on their 11-4-1 record from 1981. However, a players strike cancelled 7 of the team's 16 games. Because of this, the NFL schedule was shrunk to 9 games. The Dolphins started out fresh, winning their first 2 games prior to the strike. When season play resumed 2 months later, the Dolphins defeated the Buffalo Bills 9-7 in Buffalo to clinch a 3-0 start. After a loss to Tampa Bay, they defeated the Minnesota Vikings 22-14. The next week, they lost a brisk game against the Patriots 3-0 in a game called the Snowplow Game. The Dolphins would then win 3 straight games to end the season 7-2, tied for 2nd in the AFC with the Cincinnati Bengals. The Dolphins won 2nd place over them by virtue of a series of tiebreakers. In the playoffs, they defeated the Patriots in a rematch by the score of 28-13. They then defeated the Chargers in a rematch of the 1981 Divisional Playoffs by a score of 34-13. In the AFC Championship game, they shutout the Jets, 14-0 to reach the Super Bowl for the first time since 1973.
