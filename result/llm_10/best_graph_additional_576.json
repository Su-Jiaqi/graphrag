            "Messin' with the Boys\nMessin' with the Boys is the second post-Runaways album by Cherie Currie, released in 1980 For this album Currie worked with her identical twin sister, Marie Currie. Their band was called \"Cherie and Marie Currie\". Marie was a guest vocalist on Cherie's first album, so Marie went on tour with Cherie to support her first album, \"Beauty's Only Skin Deep\". When Marie would join Cherie on stage to sing the encores the audience would go wild. So Cherie ran with the idea of two blonds are better than one. The idea paid off because \"Messin' with the Boys\" received more radio play than \"Beauty's Only Skin Deep\", and their song \"Since You Been Gone\" made it to 95 on US charts. The single \"This Time\" and the album Messin' with the Boys made the top 200 on U.S. charts. This makes Messin' with the Boys Cherie Currie's most successful album. \"I Just Love the Feeling\" originally surfaced on the 1974 album, \"S.S. Fools\" by the group of the same name.

Despite this success, Taylor was ousted from the label by its parent, Word Entertainment, in 2001. He has produced and written for numerous musical acts, one of the most consistent being Newsboys. As a film-maker, Taylor co-wrote, directed, and produced the feature films \"Down Under the Big Top\", \"The Second Chance\", and \"Blue Like Jazz\".
